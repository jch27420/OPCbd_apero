	abstract = {The issue of shifting scales between the microscopic and the macroscopic dimensions is a recurrent one in the history of science, and in particular the history of microscopy. But it took on new dimensions in the context of early twentieth-century microscophysics, with the progressive realisation that the physical laws governing the macroscopic world were not always adequate for describing the sub-microscopic one. The paper focuses on the researches of Jean Perrin in the 1900s, in particular his use of Brownian motion to produce evidence of the existence of atoms and in favour of the kinetic theory. His results were described by many contemporaries, and subsequently by historians, as the first direct proof of atomic and molecular reality. The paper examines the different strategies developed by Perrin for bridging the macro and sub-microphysical realms and making the latter accessible to the senses; even though neither atoms nor molecules were ever actually seen, and in fact very few visual representations were shown and published in connection with these experiments. This case provides a good example of how visualizing, representing and convincing could be interwoven in the production of evidence about the sub-microphysical realm circa 1900.},

	abstract = {The periodic table of elements is among the most recognizable image in science. It lies at the core of chemistry and embodies the most fundamental principles of science. In this new edition, Eric Scerri offers readers a complete and updated history and philosophy of the periodic table. Written in a lively style to appeal to experts and interested lay-persons alike, The Periodic Table: Its Story and Its Significance begins with an overview of the importance of the periodic table and the manner in which the term "element" has been interpreted by chemists and philosophers across time. The book traces the evolution and development of the periodic table from its early beginnings with the work of the precursors like De Chancourtois, Newlands and Meyer to Mendeleev's 1869 first published table and beyond. Several chapters are devoted to developments in 20th century physics, especially quantum mechanics and and the extent to which they explain the periodic table in a more fundamental way. Other chapters examine the formation of the elements, nuclear structure, the discovery of the last seven infra-uranium elements, and the synthesis of trans-uranium elements. Finally, the book considers the many different ways of representing the periodic system and the quest for an optimal arrangement.},

	abstract = {Abstract The properties of elastic fluids (i.e. gases) depend especially on the facts that: (1) they possess weight; (2) they expand in all directions unless restrained; and (3) they allow themselves to be more and more compressed as the force of compression increases. These properties can be explained if we assume a fluid to consist of a very large number of small particles in rapid motion. If such a fluid is placed in a cylindrical container with a movable piston on which there rests a weight P, then the particles will strike against the piston and hold it up by their impacts; the fluid will expand as the weight P is moved or reduced, and will become denser if the weight is increased. We can find the relation between P and the density of the fluid by computing the effect of changing the volume underneath the piston. If the volume is decreased, the fluid will exert a greater force on the piston, first, because the number of particles is now greater in proportion to the smaller space in which they are confined, and secondly because any given particle makes more frequent impacts. If in addition we assume that the particles themselves are of negligible size, then it follows that the force of compression is approximately inversely proportional to the volume occupied by the air, if the temperature is fixed; and, if the temperature changes, the force of compression will also change, so that it will be proportional to the square of the velocity of the particles. This result enables us to measure the temperature of a gas by the pressure it exerts; the standard temperature from which the rest are measured should be obtained from boiling rainwater, because this no doubt has very nearly the same temperature all over the earth. Experiments to measure temperature and pressure are described. The theory is applied to atmospheric phenomena and to the firing of projectiles from cannons.},

The field of Bose-Einstein condensation of atomic gases has continued to progress rapidly, driven by the combination of new experimental techniques and theoretical advances. The family of quantum-degenerate gases has grown, and now includes metastable and fermionic atoms.

	abstract = {Optimization is a major part of human effort. While being mathematical, optimization is also built into physics. For example, physics has the Principle of Least Action; the Principle of Minimum Power Dissipation, also called Minimum Entropy Generation; and the Variational Principle. Physics also has Physical Annealing, which, of course, preceded computational Simulated Annealing. Physics has the Adiabatic Principle, which, in its quantum form, is called Quantum Annealing. Thus, physical machines can solve the mathematical problem of optimization, including constraints. Binary constraints can be built into the physical optimization. In that case, the machines are digital in the same sense that a flip–flop is digital. A wide variety of machines have had recent success at optimizing the Ising magnetic energy. We demonstrate in this paper that almost all those machines perform optimization according to the Principle of Minimum Power Dissipation as put forth by Onsager. Further, we show that this optimization is in fact equivalent to Lagrange multiplier optimization for constrained problems. We find that the physical gain coefficients that drive those systems actually play the role of the corresponding Lagrange multipliers.},

	abstract = {Just over 100 years ago, Henry Moseley carried out a systematic series of experiments which showed that the frequencies of the X-rays emitted from an elemental target under bombardment by cathode rays were characteristic of that element and could be used to identify the charge on its atomic nucleus. This led to a reorganization of the periodic table, with chemical elements now arranged on the basis of atomic number Z rather than atomic weight A, as had been the case in previous tables, including those developed by Mendeleev. Moseley also showed that there were four ‘missing elements’ before gold. With further measurements up to uranium Z = 92, the Swedish physicist Manne Siegbahn identified two more missing elements. This paper provides an introduction to Moseley and his experiments and then traces attempts to ‘discover’ missing elements by X-ray spectroscopy. There were two successes with hafnium (Z = 72) and rhenium (Z = 75), but many blind alleys and episodes of self-deception when dealing with elements 43, 61, 85 and 87. These all turned out to be radioactive, with extremely small natural abundances: all required synthesis by a nuclear reaction, with radiological characterization in the first instance. Finally, the paper moves on to consider the role of X-ray spectroscopy in exploring the periodic table beyond uranium. Although the discovery of artificial radioactive elements with Z {\textbackslash}textgreater 92 again depended on nucleosynthesis and radiological characterization, measurement of the frequencies or energies of characteristic X-rays remains the ultimate goal in proving the existence of an element. This article is part of the theme issue ‘Mendeleev and the periodic table’.},

Röntgen was not the first researcher to produce X-rays nor the first to take X-ray images. An analysis of the history of cathode ray research in the 19th century reveals ample evidence that researchers before Röntgen had already produced X-rays, albeit without knowing this. Most of them, for their part, did not claim any priority, some did so rather casually. The German-Hungarian physicist Philipp Lenard, a co-founder of German Physics, considered himself a “true discoverer”. It remains to be said, however, that he, like many others before him, failed to recognize the character of the new radiation. It was Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen, with his three scientific publications on X-rays, who laid the foundations for their physical clarification and paved the way for the success story of their application in a variety of fields that continues to this day.},

This radiation is regarded by many observers as a secondary radiation, but more recent experiments seem to show that it consists mainly of primary β-particles, which have been scattered inside the material to such an extent that they emerge again at the same side of the plate. For α-particles a similar effect has not previously been observed, and is perhaps not to be expected on account of the relatively small scattering which α-particles suffer in penetrating matter. In the following experiments, however, conclusive evidence was found of, the existence of a diffuse reflection of the α-particles. A small fraction of the α-particles falling upon a metal plate have their directions changed to such an extent that they emerge again at the side of incidence. To form an idea of the way in which this effect takes place, the following three points were investigated:— (I) The relative amount of reflection from different metals. (II) The relative amount of reflection from a metal of varying thickness. (Ill) The fraction of the incident α-particles which are reflected.},

	abstract = {In this article, it is shown that if a particle is at rest and has some harmonic oscillation, then a traveling particle with a constant speed corresponds to a De Broglie Wave. In 1924, De Broglie proposed that particles of matter exhibit wave like behavior, the expression for which became fundamental in the creation of wave mechanics (quantum mechanics). The main equation for this is the Schrödinger equation, which in the case of free motion of a particle becomes the expression for the De Broglie wave. This hypothesis is supported by many early experiments on the diffraction of electrons, and later the development of modern physics. However until now, the origin of this hypothesis remains unclear. We show that the expression for the De Broglie wavelength can be obtained from a more general well-known concept, that any particle at rest has a corresponding harmonic oscillation that transforms into a wave of a moving particle with the help of relativistic change of coordinates (the Lorentz transformations). In this way, a De Broglie wave can be explained as a spacetime wave.},

The object of the present dissertation is not so much to pro­pose any opinions which are absolutely new, as to refer some theories, which have been already advanced, to their original inventors, to support them by additional evidence, and to apply them to a great number of diversified facts, which have hitherto been buried in obscurity. Nor is it absolutely necessary in this instance to produce a single new experiment; for of experi­ments there is already an ample store, which are so much the more unexceptionable, as they must have been conducted with­ out the least partiality for the system by which they will be explained; yet some facts, hitherto unobserved, will be brought forwards, in order to show the perfect agreement of that system with the multifarious phenomena of nature.},

An observer bound to the portion of matter will associate with it a frequency determined by its internal energy, namely, by its “mass at rest.” An observer for whom a portion of matter is in steady motion with velocity c, will see this frequency lower in consequence of the Lorentz-Einstein time transformation. I have been able to show (Comptes rendus, September 10 and 24, of the Paris Academy of Sciences) that the fixed observer will constantly see the internal periodical phenomenon in phase with a wave the frequency of which is determined by the quantum relation using the whole energy of the moving body—provided it is assumed that the wave spreads with the velocity c/. This wave, the velocity of which is greater than c, cannot carry energy.},

To resolve the confusion we study foundational aspects of Casimir effect at a qualitative level, but also at a quantitative level within a simple toy model with only 3 degrees of freedom. In particular, we point out that Casimir vacuum is not a state without photons, and not a ground state for a Hamiltonian that can describe Casimir force. Instead, Casimir vacuum can be related to the photon vacuum by a non-trivial Bogoliubov transformation, and it is a ground state only for an effective Hamiltonian describing Casimir plates at a fixed distance. At the fundamental microscopic level, Casimir force is best viewed as a manifestation of van der Waals forces.},

	abstract = {The investigation of a preceding paper has shown that the temperature variation of viscosity, as determined experimentally, can be satisfactorily explained in many gases on the assumption that the repulsive and attractive parts of the molecular field are each according to an inverse power of the distance. In some cases, in argon, for example, it was further shown that the experimental facts can be explained by more than one molecular model, from which we inferred that viscosity results alone are insufficient to determine precisely the nature of molecular fields. The object of the present paper is to ascertain whether a molecular model of the same type will also explain available experimental data concerning the equation of state of a gas, and if so, whether the results so obtained, when taken in conjunction with those obtained from viscosity, will definitely fix the molecular field. Such an investigation is made possible by the elaborate analysis by Kamerlingh Onnes of the observational material. He has expressed the results in the form of an empirical equation of state of the type pv = A + B/v + C/v2 + D/v4 + E/v6 + F/v8, where the coefficients A ... F, called by him virial coefficients, are determined as functions of the temperature to fit the observations. Now it is possible by various methods to obtain a theoretical expression for B as a function of the temperature and a strict comparison can then be made between theory and experiment. Unfortunately the solution for B, although applicable to any molecular model of spherical symmetry, is purely formal and contains an integral which can be evaluated only in special cases. This has been done up to now for only two simple models, viz., a van der Waals molecule, and a molecule repelling according to an inverse power law (without attraction), but it is shown in this paper that it can also be evaluated in the case of the model, which was successful in explaining viscosity results. As the two other models just mentioned are particular cases of this, the appropriate formulæ for B are easily deduced from the general one given here.},

This double slit defines two possible paths on which the atoms can reach the detector slit. The good visibility of the observed fringes should make it possible to measure differential phase shifts in the interferometer of 1/3 rad in less than 10 min.},

	abstract = {The new quantum theory, based on the assumption that the dynamical variables do not obey the commutative law of multiplication, has by now been developed sufficiently to form a fairly complete theory of dynamics. One can treat mathematically the problem of any dynamical system composed of a number of particles with instantaneous forces acting between them, provided it is describable by a Hamiltonian function, and one can interpret the mathematics physically by a quite definite general method. On the other hand, hardly anything has been done up to the present on quantum electrodynamics. The questions of the correct treatment of a system in which the forces are propagated with the velocity of light instead of instantaneously, of the production of an electromagnetic field by a moving electron, and of the reaction of this field on the electron have not yet been touched. In addition, there is a serious difficulty in making the theory satisfy all the requirements of the restricted principle of relativity, since a Hamiltonian function can no longer be used. This relativity question is, of course, connected with the previous ones, and it will be impossible to answer any one question completely without at the same time answering them all. However, it appears to be possible to build up a fairly satisfactory theory of the emission of radiation and of the reaction of the radiation field on the emitting system on the basis of a kinematics and dynamics which are not strictly relativistic. This is the main object of the present paper. The theory is noil-relativistic only on account of the time being counted throughout as a c-number, instead of being treated symmetrically with the space co-ordinates. The relativity variation of mass with velocity is taken into account without difficulty. The underlying ideas of the theory are very simple. Consider an atom interacting with a field of radiation, which we may suppose for definiteness to be confined in an enclosure so as to have only a discrete set of degrees of freedom. Resolving the radiation into its Fourier components, we can consider the energy and phase of each of the components to be dynamical variables describing the radiation field. Thus if Er is the energy of a component labelled r and θr is the corresponding phase (defined as the time since the wave was in a standard phase), we can suppose each Er and θr to form a pair of canonically conjugate variables. In the absence of any interaction between the field and the atom, the whole system of field plus atom will be describable by the Hamiltonian H ═ ΣrEr + Ho equal to the total energy, Ho being the Hamiltonian for the atom alone, since the variables Er, θr obviously satisfy their canonical equations of motion Er ═ — ∂H/∂θr ═ 0, θr ═ ∂H/∂Er ═ 1.},

Loschmidt first described the structure of the benzene molecule and determined the size of air molecules, from which the number of molecules per unit volume can easily be determined, yet others received the credit for these achievements. Stefan posited the fourth-power temperature radiation law, but neither he nor his student Ludwig Boltzmann (1844–1906) calculated the proportionality constant now known as the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. These are instances of Stigler’s Law of Eponymy. Besides these achievements, perhaps the greatest unheralded contribution of both Loschmidt and Stefan was the experimental evidence they provided in support of the emerging kinetic theory of gases.},
