	abstract = {Flowers have a high risk of pathogen attack because of their rich nutrient and moisture content, and high frequency of insect visitors. We investigated the role of (E)-β-caryophyllene in floral defense against a microbial pathogen. This sesquiterpene is a common volatile compound emitted from flowers, and is a major volatile released from the stigma of Arabidopsis thaliana flowers. Arabidopsis thaliana lines lacking a functional (E)-β-caryophyllene synthase or constitutively overexpressing this gene were challenged with Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000, which is a bacterial pathogen of brassicaceous plants. Flowers of plant lines lacking (E)-β-caryophyllene emission showed greater bacterial growth on their stigmas than did wild-type flowers, and their seeds were lighter and misshapen. By contrast, plant lines with ectopic (E)-β-caryophyllene emission from vegetative parts were more resistant than wild-type plants to pathogen infection of leaves, and showed reduced cell damage and higher seed production. Based on in vitro experiments, (E)-β-caryophyllene seems to act by direct inhibition of bacterial growth, rather than by triggering defense signaling pathways. (E)-β-Caryophyllene thus appears to serve as a defense against pathogens that invade floral tissues and, like other floral volatiles, may play multiple roles in defense and pollinator attraction.},

	abstract = {Plant latex and other exudates are saps that are exuded from the points of plant damage caused either mechanically or by insect herbivory. Although many (ca. 10\%) of plant species exude latex or exudates, and although the defensive roles of plant latex against herbivorous insects have long been suggested by several studies, the detailed roles and functions of various latex ingredients, proteins and chemicals, in anti-herbivore plant defenses have not been well documented despite the wide occurrence of latex in the plant kingdom. Recently, however, substantial progress has been made. Several latex proteins, including cysteine proteases and chitin-related proteins, have been shown to play important defensive roles against insect herbivory. In the mulberry (Morus spp.)-silkworm (Bombyx mori) interaction, an old and well-known model system of plant-insect interaction, plant latex and its ingredients–sugar-mimic alkaloids and defense protein MLX56–are found to play key roles. Complicated molecular interactions between Apocynaceae species and its specialist herbivores, in which cardenolides and defense proteins in latex play key roles, are becoming more and more evident. Emerging observations suggested that plant latex, analogous to animal venom, is a treasury of useful defense proteins and chemicals that has evolved through interspecific interactions. On the other hand, specialist herbivores developed sophisticated adaptations, either molecular, physiological, or behavioral, against latex-borne defenses. The existence of various adaptations in specialist herbivores itself is evidence that latex and its ingredients function as defenses at least against generalists. Here, we review molecular and structural mechanisms, ecological roles, and evolutionary aspects of plant latex as a general defense against insect herbivory and we discuss, from recent studies, the unique characteristics of latex-borne defense systems as transport systems of defense substances are discussed based on recent studies.},

	abstract = {Since their discovery, hydrothermal vents have been relevant to concepts that surround the origin of life. At the simplest level, there are two kinds of hydrothermal vents: the hot (approximately 350°C) black smoker type, the chemistry of which is driven by the magma-chamber that resides below ocean-floor spreading zones, and the cooler (approximately 50–90°C) Lost City type, the chemistry of which is driven not by magma, but by a process called serpentinization.Serpentinization is a H2-producing geochemical reaction that has been operation in hydrothermal systems for as long as there has been water on the Earth. Its reducing power is sufficient to generate substantial amounts of abiogenic CH4 and short hydrocarbons in the effluent of some modern hydrothermal vents.In the study of the origin of life, major unresolved issues concern the source of sustained chemical energy and the source of reduced carbon compounds. The CO2-reducing geochemistry of modern hydrothermal vents provides a model for our understanding of how such processes might have been possible at the dawn of biochemistry.Methanogens and acetogens satisfy their carbon needs through the acetyl-coenzyme A pathway, an energy-releasing pathway of CO2 fixation, if given sufficient environmental H2 and CO2. The authors consider the idea that the CH4-producing and acetate-producing geochemistry of hydrothermal vents is the abiogenic precursor of modern microbial CH4 and acetate production.This suggests that the evolutionary starting point of microbial metabolism might have been an energy-releasing geochemical process in which CO2 served as the acceptor for electrons that stemmed from H2 generated by serpentinization. The naturally chemiosmotic nature of alkaline hydrothermal systems, such as Lost City, might be important to the origin of life issue, but in a somewhat unexpected way that, in turn, helps to explain why chemiosmotic coupling through ATPases is universal throughout the microbial world.},

	abstract = {The origin of oxygenic photosynthesis was the most important metabolic innovation in Earth history. It allowed life to generate energy and reducing power directly from sunlight and water, freeing it from the limited resources of geochemically derived reductants. This greatly increased global primary productivity and restructured ecosystems. The release of O2 as an end product of water oxidation led to the rise of oxygen, which dramatically altered the redox state of Earth's atmosphere and oceans and permanently changed all major biogeochemical cycles. Furthermore, the biological availability of O2 allowed for the evolution of aerobic respiration and novel biosynthetic pathways, facilitating much of the richness we associate with modern biology, including complex multicellularity. Here we critically review and synthesize information from the geological and biological records for the origin and evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis. Data from both of these archives illustrate that this metabolism first appeared in early Paleoproterozoic time and, despite its biogeochemical prominence, is a relatively late invention in the context of our planet's history.},

	abstract = {We review the major subglacial till forming processes as presently understood by glacial researchers and define the parameters within which tills are produced and reconcile them with sedimentary end members. Processes of deformation, flow, sliding, lodgement and ploughing coexist at the base of temperate glacier ice and act to mobilize and transport sediment and deposit it as various end members, ranging from glacitectonically folded and faulted stratified material to texturally homogeneous diamicton. The dominance of any one subglacial process varies both spatially and temporally, giving rise to the possibility that a till or complex till sequence contains a superimposed signature of former transportation/deposition at the ice-bed interface. We recommend that, while glacial geologists and geomorphologists should be able to recognize the sedimentary imprints of various subglacial processes, genetic fingerprinting of subglacial tills should be less process-specific and till classification must reflect the range of products encompassed by the subglacial till production continuum. Glacial geologists can presently unequivocally identify: a) glacitectonite (rock or sediment that has been deformed by subglacial shearing/deformation but retains some of the structural characteristics of the parent material); b) subglacial traction till (sediment deposited by a glacier sole either sliding over and/or deforming its bed, the sediment having been released directly from the ice by pressure melting and/or liberated from the substrate and then disaggregated and completely or largely homogenised by shearing); and support the theoretical case for c) melt-out till (sediment released by the melting of stagnant or slowly moving debris-rich glacier ice, and directly deposited without subsequent transport or deformation). Because observations on contemporary glaciers reveal that their beds are most likely to be mosaics of deformation and sliding and warm based and cold based conditions, the patterns of which change temporally and spatially, it is extremely unlikely that subglacial till end members in the geological record will be anything but hybrids produced by the range of processes operative in the subglacial traction zone.},

Rapid sediment entrainment producing thick debris-rich basal zones may occur by regelation into subglacial materials, and by freeze-on from rising supercooled waters. Numerous other mechanisms may be important but primarily near ice margins, especially those of advancing or fluctuating glaciers.

It differs from previously published reviews by focusing on three topics critical to the development of the Great Lakes: the glaciation of the Great Lakes watershed during the late Cenozoic, the evolution of the Great Lakes since the last glacial maximum, and the record of lake levels and coastal erosion in modern times. The Great Lakes are a product of glacial scour and were partially or totally covered by glacier ice at least six times since 0.78 Ma. During retreat of the last ice sheet large proglacial lakes developed in the Great Lakes watershed. Their levels and areas varied considerably as the oscillating ice margin opened and closed outlets at differing elevations and locations; they were also significantly affected by channel downcutting, crustal rebound, and catastrophic inflows from other large glacial lakes. Today, lake level changes of about a 1/3 m annually, and up to 2 m over 10 to 20 year time periods, are mainly climatically-driven. Various engineering works provide small control on lake levels for some but not all the Great Lakes. Although not as pronounced as former changes, these subtle variations in lake level have had a significant effect on shoreline erosion, which is often a major concern of coastal residents.},

Conversely, if increases of plant-derived carbon inputs to soils exceed increases in decomposition, the feedback would be negative. Despite much research, a consensus has not yet emerged on the temperature sensitivity of soil carbon decomposition. Unravelling the feedback effect is particularly difficult, because the diverse soil organic compounds exhibit a wide range of kinetic properties, which determine the intrinsic temperature sensitivity of their decomposition.

	abstract = {The carbon sink capacity of the world's agricultural and degraded soils is 50 to 66\% of the historic carbon loss of 42 to 78 gigatons of carbon. The rate of soil organic carbon sequestration with adoption of recommended technologies depends on soil texture and structure, rainfall, temperature, farming system, and soil management. Strategies to increase the soil carbon pool include soil restoration and woodland regeneration, no-till farming, cover crops, nutrient management, manuring and sludge application, improved grazing, water conservation and harvesting, efficient irrigation, agroforestry practices, and growing energy crops on spare lands. An increase of 1 ton of soil carbon pool of degraded cropland soils may increase crop yield by 20 to 40 kilograms per hectare (kg/ha) for wheat, 10 to 20 kg/ha for maize, and 0.5 to 1 kg/ha for cowpeas. As well as enhancing food security, carbon sequestration has the potential to offset fossil fuel emissions by 0.4 to 1.2 gigatons of carbon per year, or 5 to 15\% of the global fossil-fuel emissions.},

	abstract = {Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are important contributors to both plant and soil health. Twenty-five years ago, researchers discovered 'glomalin', a soil component potentially produced by AMF, which was unconventionally extracted from soil and bound by a monoclonal antibody raised against Rhizophagus irregularis spores. 'Glomalin' can resist boiling, strong acids and bases, and protease treatment. Researchers proposed that 'glomalin' is a 60 kDa heat shock protein produced by AMF, while others suggested that it is a mixture of soil organic materials that are not unique to AMF. Despite disagreements on the nature of 'glomalin', it has been consistently associated with a long list of plant and soil health benefits, including soil aggregation, soil carbon storage and enhancing growth under abiotic stress. The benefits attributed to 'glomalin' have caused much excitement in the plant and soil health community; however, the mechanism(s) for these benefits have yet to be established. This review provides insights into the current understanding of the identity of 'glomalin', 'glomalin' quantification, and the associated benefits of 'glomalin'. We invite the community to think more critically about how glomalin-associated benefits are generated. We suggest a series of experiments to test hypotheses regarding the nature of 'glomalin' and associated health benefits.},

Thus, 360 soil samples were collected from 72 farmland 1-m soil profiles in northeastern China, and soil physiochemical properties, nutrients, glomalin characteristics, local climates were determined. Linear decreases of glomalin amounts were observed from the top to deep soils, and glomalin/SOC (glomalin ratio to total SOC) in the 80–100 cm soil (EEG, easily-extracted GRSP, 2.2\%; TG, total GRSP, 19\%) was 1.34–1.5-fold higher than did in the 0–20 cm soil. Different statistical analyses crosschecked that the lower pH and higher SOC usually accompanied with the higher EEG and TG, while EEG was more sensitive to climates; Moreover, glomalin was more physiochemical-regulated in the deep soils, but more nutrient-regulation was found in the surface soils. Structure Equation Model showed that soil depths and climates indirectly affected TG and EEG features through soil properties, except significant direct effects on EEG. In future, glomalin assessment should fully consider these for identifying the AMF importance in the whole 1-m profile, and our findings also favor degrade soil improvement from glomalin rehabilitation.},

The fungi colonize the cortex of the root to obtain carbon from their plant host, while assisting the plant with the uptake of phosphate and other mineral nutrients from the soil2–5. This association is beneficial to the plant, because phosphate is essential for plant growth and development, especially during growth under nutrient-limiting conditions2,6–8. Molecular genetic studies of these fungi and their interaction with plants have been limited owing to the obligate symbiotic nature of the VA fungi, so the molecular mechanisms underlying fungal-mediated uptake and translocation of phosphate from the soil to the plant remain unknown. Here we begin to investigate this process by identifying a complementary DNA that encodes a trans-membrane phosphate transporter (GvPT) from Glomus versiforme, a VA mycorrhizal fungus. The function of the protein encoded by GvPT was confirmed by complementation of a yeast phosphate transport mutant. Expression of GvPT was localized to the external hyphae of G. versiforme during mycorrhizal associations, these being the initial site of phosphate uptake from the soil.},

	abstract = {Understanding the contributions of soil microorganisms to soil stabilization at the molecular level will lead to ways to enhance inputs for sustainable agricultural systems. Recent discoveries of copious production of glycoprotein (glomalin) by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and the apparent recalcitrance of this material in soils led to the comparison between concentration of glomalin and aggregate stability. Stability was measured on air-dried aggregates rewetted by capillary action and then subjected to wet sieving for 10 min. Thirty-seven samples from four geographic areas of the U.S. and one area of Scotland were tested. The monoclonal antibody used to discover glomalin on AM hyphae was employed to assess immunoreactive glomalin on aggregate surfaces by immunofluorescence and in extracts from aggregates by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Immunofluorescence was observed on at least some surfaces of aggregates from all soils examined, but was most evident on aggregates with high glomalin concentrations. Easily extractable glomalin (EEG) was solubilized by 20 mM citrate, pH 7.0 at 121 °C for 30 min, and total glomalin (TG) was solubilized with 50 mM citrate, pH 8.0 at 121 °C for 90 to 450 min. Some soils required up to seven sequential extractions to remove all of the glomalin. Aggregate stability was linearly correlated (p {\textless} 0.001) with all measures of glomalin (mg/g of aggregates) in these soils. The best predictor of aggregate stability (AS) was immunoreactive easily extractable glomalin (IREEG) according to the following relationship: AS = 42.7 +61.3 × log10 IREEG (r2 = 0.86; p {\textless}0.001, n = 37).},

	abstract = {Soils play a pivotal role in major global biogeochemical cycles (carbon, nutrient, and water), while hosting the largest diversity of organisms on land. Because of this, soils deliver fundamental ecosystem services, and management to change a soil process in support of one ecosystem service can either provide co-benefits to other services or result in trade-offs. In this critical review, we report the state-of-the-art understanding concerning the biogeochemical cycles and biodiversity in soil, and relate these to the provisioning, regulating, supporting, and cultural ecosystem services which they underpin. We then outline key knowledge gaps and research challenges, before providing recommendations for management activities to support the continued delivery of ecosystem services from soils. 

 We conclude that, although soils are complex, there are still knowledge gaps, and fundamental research is still needed to better understand the relationships between different facets of soils and the array of ecosystem services they underpin, enough is known to implement best practices now. There is a tendency among soil scientists to dwell on the complexity and knowledge gaps rather than to focus on what we do know and how this knowledge can be put to use to improve the delivery of ecosystem services. A significant challenge is to find effective ways to share knowledge with soil managers and policy makers so that best management can be implemented. A key element of this knowledge exchange must be to raise awareness of the ecosystems services underpinned by soils and thus the natural capital they provide. We know enough to start moving in the right direction while we conduct research to fill in our knowledge gaps. The lasting legacy of the International Year of Soils in 2015 should be for soil scientists to work together with policy makers and land managers to put soils at the centre of environmental policy making and land management decisions.},

	abstract = {The soil is important in sequestering atmospheric CO2 and in emitting trace gases (e.g. CO2, CH4 and N2O) that are radiatively active and enhance the ‘greenhouse’ effect. Land use changes and predicted global warming, through their effects on net primary productivity, the plant community and soil conditions, may have important effects on the size of the organic matter pool in the soil and directly affect the atmospheric concentration of these trace gases. A discrepancy of approximately 350 × 1015 g (or Pg) of C in two recent estimates of soil carbon reserves worldwide is evaluated using the geo-referenced database developed for the World Inventory of Soil Emission Potentials (WISE) project. This database holds 4353 soil profiles distributed globally which are considered to represent the soil units shown on a 1/2° latitude by 1/2° longitude version of the corrected and digitized 1:5 M FAO–UNESCO Soil Map of the World. Total soil carbon pools for the entire land area of the world, excluding carbon held in the litter layer and charcoal, amounts to 2157–2293 Pg of C in the upper 100 cm. Soil organic carbon is estimated to be 684–724 Pg of C in the upper 30 cm, 1462–1548 Pg of C in the upper 100 cm, and 2376–2456 Pg of C in the upper 200 cm. Although deforestation, changes in land use and predicted climate change can alter the amount of organic carbon held in the superficial soil layers rapidly, this is less so for the soil carbonate carbon. An estimated 695–748 Pg of carbonate-C is held in the upper 100 cm of the world's soils. Mean C: N ratios of soil organic matter range from 9.9 for arid Yermosols to 25.8 for Histosols. Global amounts of soil nitrogen are estimated to be 133–140 Pg of N for the upper 100 cm. Possible changes in soil organic carbon and nitrogen dynamics caused by increased concentrations of atmospheric CO2 and the predicted associated rise in temperature are discussed.},

It is argued that soil has an integral part to play in the global environmental sustainability challenges of food security, water security, energy sustainability, climate stability, biodiversity, and ecosystem service delivery. Indeed, soil has the same existential status as these issues and should be recognized and highlighted similarly. The concept of soil security is multi-dimensional. It acknowledges the five dimensions of (1) capability, (2) condition, (3) capital, (4) connectivity and (5) codification, of soil entities which encompass the social, economic and biophysical sciences and recognize policy and legal frameworks.

Previous efforts to enumerate soil biodiversity consider only certain types of organisms (e.g., animals) or report values for diverse groups without partitioning species that live in soil versus other habitats. Here, we reviewed the biodiversity literature to show that soil is likely home to 59 ± 15\% of the species on Earth. We therefore estimate an approximately two times greater soil biodiversity than previous estimates, and we include representatives from the simplest (microbial) to most complex (mammals) organisms. Enchytraeidae have the greatest percentage of species in soil (98.6\%), followed by fungi (90\%), Plantae (85.5\%), and Isoptera (84.2\%). Our results demonstrate that soil is the most biodiverse singular habitat. By using this estimate of soil biodiversity, we can more accurately and quantitatively advocate for soil organismal conservation and restoration as a central goal of the Anthropocene.},

	abstract = {It has taken time for the international community to accept the idea of biodiversity values, a concept which had previously been restricted to the limited aesthetic and touristic aspects of wildlife. This situation changed following the International Convention on Biodiversity in Rio de Janeiro (1992), which focussed on “the forgotten environmental problem” of biodiversity erosion and made the first clear reference to the values of living species. Biodiversity values refer to direct or indirect, economic or non-economic interest, a given species or ecosystem may represent for human populations. These values are generally split into intrinsic and instrumental (use) values, the last category itself being divided into direct and indirect economic values. Obviously, each of these values carries different weights, and cannot be considered as being weighted equally in terms of justification for species or ecosystem conservation. Soil is probably one of the most species-rich habitats of terrestrial ecosystems, especially if the definition is extended to related habitats like vertebrate faeces, decaying wood, and humus of hollow trees (i.e. epiphytic soils). The diversity of soil communities (sensu lato) thus probably encompasses a large part of terrestrial animals. This highly speciose fauna has been the subject of recent research efforts, and current trends in soil fauna studies include aspects of biology, autecology, ecotoxicology, or functional ecology. During the past 20 years, recognition of the importance of soil fauna in the functioning of soils and by extension of terrestrial ecosystems has been continuously growing, ending in some important applications in agronomy. However, despite the general agreement about the ecological importance of soil fauna and its economic consequences, the absence of concern about this group from conservationists in their studies is conspicuous. This paper aims at presenting soil fauna within the scope of conservation biology concepts, trying to identify the different values of soil fauna and how they participe to the provisioning of key ecosystem services. Finally, the enormous gap between their recognised usefulness and their consideration in protection policies is discussed.},

Taking the mean of most of these new estimates indicates that globally there are approximately 1.5 million, 5.5 million, and 7 million species of beetles, insects, and terrestrial arthropods, respectively. Previous estimates of 30 million species or more based on the host specificity of insects to plants now seem extremely unlikely. With 1 million insect species named, this suggests that 80\% remain to be discovered and that a greater focus should be placed on less-studied taxa such as many families of Coleoptera, Diptera, and Hymenoptera and on poorly sampled parts of the world. DNA tools have revealed many new species in taxonomically intractable groups, but unbiased studies of previously well-researched insect faunas indicate that 1–2\% of species may be truly cryptic.},

	abstract = {Current knowledge suggests a high redundancy of soil organism communities, i.e. saturation of function at low levels of species richness. This does not imply, however, that research on soil organism biodiversity and its function is irrelevant. First, it is well established that several species of the decomposer community are functionally more important than others. The ‘step’ hypothesis developed in this paper shows that under these conditions random loss of species is much more likely to impact ecosystem processes than expected from the redundancy hypothesis. Second, redundant species may gain functional significance by interacting with functionally important species. Third, the number of ‘important species’ is increased by the multiplicity of functions carried out by soil biota. And finally, alteration in species composition will not be a random process. In fact, functionally important soil biota might be among the first to be affected by large-scale changes in land use. Even if we were to accept that conservation efforts should be confined to the functionally most important species, we would have no idea how to do so. Crossing the ‘spatial barrier’ seems to be the biggest challenge for future investigations on soil biodiversity, because traditional approaches of community ecology will not be sufficient to answer the questions originating from large-scale impoverishment of the soil fauna. Some examples of promising macroecological topics are discussed: (i) the impact of the regional species pool on local species richness, (ii) the relationship between α- and γ-diversity, and (iii) abundance-occupancy relationships. It is argued that research in this direction will be essential for answering the question of how populations and communities must be organised to resist alterations of the soil habitat at the landscape-level.},

Understanding and quantifying how bacteriophages drive these processes, requires both technological developments to take measurements in situ, and laboratory-based studies to understand mechanisms. Technological advances have allowed quantification of the number of infected cells in situ, revealing far-lower levels than expected.

Estimating the size and spatial distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) loss due to land use and land cover change has been difficult but is a critical step in understanding whether SOC sequestration can be an effective climate mitigation strategy. In this study, a machine learning-based model was fitted using a global compilation of SOC data and the History Database of the Global Environment (HYDE) land use data in combination with climatic, landform and lithology covariates. Model results compared favorably with a global compilation of paired plot studies. Projection of this model onto a world without agriculture indicated a global carbon debt due to agriculture of 133 Pg C for the top 2 m of soil, with the rate of loss increasing dramatically in the past 200 years. The HYDE classes “grazing” and “cropland” contributed nearly equally to the loss of SOC. There were higher percent SOC losses on cropland but since more than twice as much land is grazed, slightly higher total losses were found from grazing land. Important spatial patterns of SOC loss were found: Hotspots of SOC loss coincided with some major cropping regions as well as semiarid grazing regions, while other major agricultural zones showed small losses and even net gains in SOC. This analysis has demonstrated that there are identifiable regions which can be targeted for SOC restoration efforts.},

The ice cover over Newfoundland and the Maritime Provinces of Canada is usually referred to as the Appalachian Ice Complex, because ice flowed out from local centres rather than from the Canadian Shield. All of the peripheral ice sheets were confluent at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) with the Laurentide Ice Sheet, and the Greenland Ice Sheet was confluent with the Innuitian Ice Sheet. The nucleus of this complex, the Laurentide, comprised three major sectors, the Labrador Sector, the Keewatin Sector, and the Baffin Sector, named for areas of inception mid probable areas of outflow at LGM and located respectively east, west and north of Hudson Bay.

	abstract = {This paper describes the ways in which the major rock-forming primary minerals (olivine, pyroxenes, amphiboles, feldspars, micas and chlorites) break down during weathering, the products that develop during this breakdown and the rates at which this breakdown occurs. The perspective chosen to illustrate this vast topic is that of the residual soil weathering profile. Different physical and chemical conditions characterize the various parts of such a profile. Thus, in the slightly weathered rock at the base of the profile, mineral weathering will take place in microfissures and narrow solution channels and the capillary water in such spatially restricted volumes may be expected to be close to equilibrium with the primary mineral. In these circumstances, the weathering product formed may be closely related to the primary mineral both compositionally and structurally. The saprolite higher up in the weathering profile may or may not retain the fabric and structure of the original parent rock, but in either case the close relationship observed between primary mineral and weathering product in the slightly weathered rock may be lost. This part of the profile will usually be affected by freely flowing drainage waters, the composition of which will be far from equilibrium with specific primary minerals. Weathering products which do form are likely to reflect the interaction between bulk water and bulk parent material. In the soil profile, the situation will be further complicated by organic ligands derived from decomposing organic matter or from the direct activities of soil microbes or plant roots. Thus, biological weathering will assume a much greater significance in this part of the profile compared with the mainly inorganic processes dominating in the saprolite and the slightly weathered rock. The general nature of any particular weathering profile will reflect the interactions between climate, topography, parent material, soil biota and time and superimposed upon this complexity, when considering how individual primary minerals break down in detail, will be factors related to the nature of the mineral itself. Particularly important in this respect is the inherent susceptibility of the mineral to weathering, which is related to overall chemical composition and structure, as well as the distribution and density of defects, dislocations and exsolution features, which often control the progress of the weathering reaction.},

	abstract = {Organic acids and their anions (for brevity we shall use the term “acids” to include both) may affect mineral weathering rates by at least three mechanisms: by changing the dissolution rate far from equilibrium through decreasing solution pH or forming complexes with cations at the mineral surface; by affecting the saturation state of the solution with respect to the mineral; and by affecting the speciation in solution of ions such as Al3+ that themselves affect mineral dissolution rate. In this paper we review the effects of organic acids on the dissolution rates of silicate minerals, particularly feldspars, under conditions approximating the natural weathering environment −25°C, pH 4–7 and with concentrations of organic acids comparable to those measured in soil solutions. Feldspar dissolution rates far from equilibrium increase with decreasing pH below pH 4–5. They appear to be independent of pH between pH 4–5 and about 8, and above pH 8 feldspar dissolution rates increase with increasing pH. Small chelating ligands such as oxalate appear to accelerate feldspar dissolution through complexation of Al at the surface of the mineral. Feldspar dissolution rates in the presence of 1 mM oxalic acid show effects ranging from no enhancement to enhancements of a factor of 15, depending upon the data set, pH, and aluminum content of the mineral: there is a great deal of scatter in the available data. In general, concentrations of oxalate of the order of 1 mM are necessary to cause a significant effect. Humic acids do not appear to increase feldspar dissolution rates significantly. Dissolution rates must decrease as the solution approaches saturation with respect to the primary phase (the chemical affinity effect). Organic acids will influence chemical affinity by complexing Al (and possibly other elements) in solution and hence decreasing the chemical activity of Al3+. There are essentially no data on the effect of chemical affinity on feldspar dissolution rate at 25°C and mildly acid pH, so it is hard to evaluate the importance of organic acids in accelerating silicate dissolution through the chemical affinity effect. The effect of complexation of dissolved Al does not appear to be an important determinant of silicate dissolution rates in nature. Observed rates of silicate weathering in the field are typically much slower than predicted from laboratory experiments far from equilibrium, suggesting control by transport of solutes between “micropores” and “macropores” (“micropores” include fractures and crystal defects within grains). If such transport is rate-controlling, analysis of the effect of organic acids on weathering rates in nature in terms of dissolution rates far from equilibrium may be misleading.},

	abstract = {Mountain building results in high erosion rates and the interaction of rocks with the atmosphere, water and life. Carbon transfers that result from increased erosion could control the evolution of Earth’s long-term climate. For decades, attention has focused on the hypothesized role of mountain building in drawing down atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) via silicate weathering. However, it is now recognized that mountain building and erosion affect the carbon cycle in other important ways. For example, erosion mobilizes organic carbon (OC) from terrestrial vegetation, transferring it to rivers and sediments, and thereby acting to draw down atmospheric CO2 in tandem with silicate weathering. Meanwhile, exhumation of sedimentary rocks can release CO2 through the oxidation of rock OC and sulfide minerals. In this Review, we examine the mechanisms of carbon exchange between rocks and the atmosphere, and discuss the balance of CO2 sources and sinks. It is demonstrated that OC burial and oxidative weathering, not widely considered in most models, control the net CO2 budget associated with erosion. Lithology strongly influences the impact of mountain building on the global carbon cycle, with an orogeny dominated by sedimentary rocks, and thus abundant rock OC and sulfides, tending towards being a CO2 source.},

	abstract = {There has been considerable controversy concerning the role of chemical weathering in the regulation of the atmospheric partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and thus the strength of the greenhouse effect and global climate. Arguments center on the sensitivity of chemical weathering to climatic factors, especially temperature. Laboratory studies reveal a strong dependence of mineral dissolution on temperature, but the expression of this dependence in the field is often obscured by other environmental factors that co-vary with temperature. In the field, the clearest correlation is between chemical erosion rates and runoff, indicating an important dependence on the intensity of the hydrological cycle. Numerical models and interpretation of the geologic record reveal that chemical weathering has played a substantial role in both maintaining climatic stability over the eons as well as driving climatic swings in response to tectonic and paleogeographic factors.},

	abstract = {The approach that most animal cells employ to regulate intracellular pH (pHi) is not too different conceptually from the way a sophisticated system might regulate the temperature of a house. Just as the heat capacity (C) of a house minimizes sudden temperature (T) shifts caused by acute cold and heat loads, the buffering power (β) of a cell minimizes sudden pHi shifts caused by acute acid and alkali loads. However, increasing C (or β) only minimizes T (or pHi) changes; it does not eliminate the changes, return T (or pHi) to normal, or shift steady-state T (or pHi). Whereas a house may have a furnace to raise T, a cell generally has more than one acid-extruding transporter (which exports acid and/or imports alkali) to raise pHi. Whereas an air conditioner lowers T, a cell generally has more than one acid-loading transporter to lower pHi. Just as a house might respond to graded decreases (or increases) in T by producing graded increases in heat (or cold) output, cells respond to graded decreases (or increases) in pHi with graded increases (or decreases) in acid-extrusion (or acid-loading) rate. Steady-state T (or pHi) can change only in response to a change in chronic cold (or acid) loading or chronic heat (or alkali) loading as produced, for example, by a change in environmental T (or pH) or a change in the kinetics of the furnace (or acid extrudes) or air conditioner (or acid loaders). Finally, just as a temperature-control system might benefit from environmental sensors that provide clues about cold and heat loading, at least some cells seem to have extracellular CO2 or extracellular HCO3− sensors that modulate acid-base transport.},

The inhibitors bind to the catalytic zinc ion within the enzyme cavity.Several such derivatives are clinically used inhibitors, such as acetazolamide, methazolamide, ethoxzolamide, dichlorophenamide, dorzolamide, brinzolamide, topiramate, zonisamide, sulpiride, sukthiame, celecoxib and valdecoxib among others. Several compounds are in clinical development, such as indisulam and COUMATE-667.CA inhibitors (CAIs) are used in therapy as diuretic and antiglaucoma agents but also show anti-obesity and antitumour effects. Some compounds are in clinical development for such applications (obesity and cancer).Most CAIs that are currently available show undesired side effects due to indiscriminate inhibition of CA isoforms other than the target one.Many new CAIs are developed in the search of isozyme-selective compounds as potential drugs with fewer side effects.Bacterial, fungal and protozoan CAs present in many pathogens have recently been considered as potential targets for the development of inhibitors with therapeutic applications.CA activators (CAAs) participate in the enzyme catalytic cycle by facilitating the rate-determining step: a release of a proton from the zinc-coordinated water molecule to the reaction medium.CAAs from various classes of compounds were developed in the past and characterized by means of X-ray crystallography and kinetic measurements. Such derivatives may lead to the development of anti-Alzheimer's disease agents and therapies to enhance memory.},

	abstract = {Understanding water movement through a glacier is fundamental to several critical issues in glaciology, including glacier dynamics, glacier-induced floods, and the prediction of runoff from glacierized drainage basins. To this end we have synthesized a conceptual model of water movement through a temperate glacier from the surface to the outlet stream. Processes that regulate the rate and distribution of water input at the glacier surface and that regulate water movement from the surface to the bed play important but commonly neglected roles in glacier hydrology. Where a glacier is covered by a layer of porous, permeable firn (the accumulation zone), the flux of water to the glacier interior varies slowly because the firn temporarily stores water and thereby smooths out variations in the supply rate. In the firn-free ablation zone, in contrast, the flux of water into the glacier depends directly on the rate of surface melt or rainfall and therefore varies greatly in time. Water moves from the surface to the bed through an upward branching arborescent network consisting of both steeply inclined conduits, formed by the enlargement of intergranular veins, and gently inclined conduits, spawned by water flow along the bottoms of near-surface fractures (crevasses). Englacial drainage conduits deliver water to the glacier bed at a limited number of points, probably a long distance downglacier of where water enters the glacier. Englacial conduits supplied from the accumulation zone are quasi steady state features that convey the slowly varying water flux delivered via the firn. Their size adjusts so that they are usually full of water and flow is pressurized. In contrast, water flow in englacial conduits supplied from the ablation area is pressurized only near times of peak daily flow or during rainstorms; flow is otherwise in an open-channel configuration. The subglacial drainage system typically consists of several elements that are distinct both morphologically and hydrologically. An upglacier branching, arborescent network of channels incised into the basal ice conveys water rapidly. Much of the water flux to the bed probably enters directly into the arborescent channel network, which covers only a small fraction of the glacier bed. More extensive spatially is a nonarborescent network, which commonly includes cavities (gaps between the glacier sole and bed), channels incised into the bed, and a layer of permeable sediment. The nonarborescent network conveys water slowly and is usually poorly connected to the arborescent system. The arborescent channel network largely collapses during winter but reforms in the spring as the first flush of meltwater to the bed destabilizes the cavities within the nonarborescent network. The volume of water stored by a glacier varies diurnally and seasonally. Small, temperate alpine glaciers seem to attain a maximum seasonal water storage of ∼200 mm of water averaged over the area of the glacier bed, with daily fluctuations of as much as 20–30 mm. The likely storage capacity of subglacial cavities is insufficient to account for estimated stored water volumes, so most water storage may actually occur englacially. Stored water may also be released abruptly and catastrophically in the form of outburst floods.},

Unit-cell parameters are: a = 5.1535(3) Å, b = 8.9419(5) Å, c = 7.3906(4) Å, α = 91.926(2)°, β = 105.046(2)°, γ = 89.797(2)°, and V = 328.70(5) Å3. Unit-cell parameters show that most of the thermal contraction occurred along the [001] direction, apparently due to a decrease in the interlayer distance. The non-H structure is very similar to published C1 structures, considering the low temperature of data collection, but the H atom positions are distinct. The inner OH group is essentially in the plane of the layers, and the inner-surface OH groups make angles of 60°–73° with the (001) plane. Difference-Fourier maps show minor anisotropy of the inner-OH group in the [001] direction, but the inner-surface OH groups appear to have their largest vibrational (or positional disorder) component parallel to the layers. Although no data indicate a split position of any of the H sites in kaolinite, there is support for limited random positional disorder of the H atoms. However, these data provided no support for a space group symmetry lower than C1.},

Consistent with contemporary studies, PHA sorption increased with increasing ionic strength and decreasing pH, and the presence of the background electrolyte Ca2+ largely enhanced sorption in comparison to Na+. An attempt was made to separate the contributions of various modes of interactions to PHA sorption in our experiments, where ligand exchange was estimated to account for approximately 32\% of PHA sorption on clay surfaces, van der Waals 22\% and cation bridging 41\% when Ca2+ was the background electrolyte. Kaolinite displayed higher adsorption for PHA than montmorillonite under the same solution conditions, which is explained by selective sorption of PHA by different clays and different binding mechanisms. 1H High Resolution Magic Angle Spinning (HR-MAS) NMR was employed to examine the chemical nature of mineral-bound PHA. By employing 1H NMR techniques, direct evidence for the selective sorption of CH2 groups and proteins on clay mineral surfaces was obtained. Montmorillonite displayed a higher uptake of aromatics and proteins while more CH2 groups were observed to sorb to kaolinite surfaces.},

	abstract = {The evidence presented by numerous investigations of the interface between lichens and their rock substrates strongly suggests that the weathering of minerals can be accelerated by the growth of at least some lichen species. The effects of lichens on their mineral substrates can be attributed to both physical and chemical processes. The physical effects are reflected by the mechanical disruption of rocks caused by hyphal penetration, expansion and contraction of lichen thallus, swelling action of the organic and inorganic salts originating from lichen activity. Lichens also have significant impact in the chemical weathering of rocks by the excretion of various organic acids, particularly oxalic acid, which can effectively dissolve minerals and chelate metallic cations. As a result of the weathering induced by lichens, many rock-forming minerals exhibit extensive surface corrosion. The precipitation of poorly ordered iron oxides and amorphous alumino-silica gels, the neoformation of crystalline metal oxalates and secondary clay minerals have been frequently identified in a variety of rocks colonized by lichens in nature. For a better understanding of the impacts of lichens on environments, further work on the comprehensive involvement of the lichen effects on weathering of natural rocks, deterioration of building stones and stonework, and formation of primitive soils should be carried out.},

	abstract = {Soil viruses are abundant, but the influence of the environment and climate on soil viruses remains poorly understood. Here, we addressed this gap by comparing the diversity, abundance, lifestyle, and metabolic potential of DNA viruses in three grassland soils with historical differences in average annual precipitation, low in eastern Washington (WA), high in Iowa (IA), and intermediate in Kansas (KS). Bioinformatics analyses were applied to identify a total of 2,631 viral contigs, including 14 complete viral genomes from three deep metagenomes (1 terabase [Tb] each) that were sequenced from bulk soil DNA. An additional three replicate metagenomes (∼0.5 Tb each) were obtained from each location for statistical comparisons. Identified viruses were primarily bacteriophages targeting dominant bacterial taxa. Both viral and host diversity were higher in soil with lower precipitation. Viral abundance was also significantly higher in the arid WA location than in IA and KS. More lysogenic markers and fewer clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) spacer hits were found in WA, reflecting more lysogeny in historically drier soil. More putative auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) were also detected in WA than in the historically wetter locations. The AMGs occurring in 18 pathways could potentially contribute to carbon metabolism and energy acquisition in their hosts. Structural equation modeling (SEM) suggested that historical precipitation influenced viral life cycle and selection of AMGs. The observed and predicted relationships between soil viruses and various biotic and abiotic variables have value for predicting viral responses to environmental change. IMPORTANCE Soil viruses are abundant but poorly understood. Because soil viruses regulate the dynamics of their hosts and potentially key processes in soil ecology, it is important to understand them better. Here, we leveraged massive DNA sequencing to unearth previously unknown soil viruses. We found that soil viruses differed across a historical gradient of precipitation. We compared soil viruses from Iowa, which is traditionally wetter, to those from Washington, which is traditionally drier, and from Kansas, which is intermediate. This study provides strong evidence that changes in historical precipitation impact not only the types of soil viruses but also their functional potential.},

A few studies have demonstrated a critical role of chemical communication in establishing highly specialized relationships, but the general role for root exudates in structuring the soil fungal community is poorly described. This study demonstrates that two model plant species (Arabidopsis thaliana and Medicago truncatula) are able to maintain resident soil fungal populations but unable to maintain nonresident soil fungal populations. This is mediated largely through root exudates: the effects of adding in vitro-generated root exudates to the soil fungal community were qualitatively and quantitatively similar to the results observed for plants grown in those same soils. This effect is observed for total fungal biomass, phylotype diversity, and overall community similarity to the starting community. Nonresident plants and root exudates influenced the fungal community by both positively and negatively impacting the relative abundance of individual phylotypes. A net increase in fungal biomass was observed when nonresident root exudates were added to resident plant treatments, suggesting that increases in specific carbon substrates and/or signaling compounds support an increased soil fungal population load. This study establishes root exudates as a mechanism through which a plant is able to regulate soil fungal community composition.},

Here we report the first identification of an insect-induced belowground plant signal, (E)-β-caryophyllene, which strongly attracts an entomopathogenic nematode. Maize roots release this sesquiterpene in response to feeding by larvae of the beetle Diabrotica virgifera virgifera, a maize pest that is currently invading Europe. Most North American maize lines do not release (E)-β-caryophyllene, whereas European lines and the wild maize ancestor, teosinte, readily do so in response to D. v. virgifera attack. This difference was consistent with striking differences in the attractiveness of representative lines in the laboratory. Field experiments showed a fivefold higher nematode infection rate of D. v. virgifera larvae on a maize variety that produces the signal than on a variety that does not, whereas spiking the soil near the latter variety with authentic (E)-β-caryophyllene decreased the emergence of adult D. v. virgifera to less than half. North American maize lines must have lost the signal during the breeding process. Development of new varieties that release the attractant in adequate amounts should help enhance the efficacy of nematodes as biological control agents against root pests like D. v. virgifera.},

	abstract = {2015 was the United Nations International Year of Soils and, for
the first time, soils and the life within them were in the spotlight
globally. An international group
of experts and scientists from the European Commission’s Joint
Research Centre (JRC), in close collaboration with colleagues
from the Commission’s Directorate-General for the Environment
and the Global Soil Biodiversity Initiative, have produced the first
ever Global Soil Biodiversity Atlas.
Soils are vital for human survival and underpin many sectors of
our economy. It is estimated that 99\% of the world’s food comes
from the terrestrial environment. But soils are also home to over a
quarter of global biodiversity. Millions of soil-dwelling organisms
promote essential ecosystem services – from plant growth to
food production. They support biodiversity, benefit human health,
promote the regulation of nutrient cycles that in turn influence
climate, and represent an unexplored capital of natural sources.
Our knowledge of soil life is growing continuously, thanks to
recent technological advances and awareness of its value.
However, it is estimated that only 1\% of soil microorganism
species have been identified. Therefore, understanding the highly
complex and dynamic life below ground remains one of the most
fascinating challenges facing scientists today. A clearer picture
of our soils will allow us to better understand environmental and
global climate change processes whilst also exploring possible
adaptation strategies.
Pressures on soil organisms are well known. An ever increasing
global population, and increased demand for food and fibre lead
to intensified agriculture, greater use of fertilisers and pesticides
as well as monocultures. Unsustainable agricultural practices,
climate change, soil erosion and loss of aboveground diversity all
negatively affect organisms that live in soil. To develop actions
that will preserve soil life, we need to better understand the
consequences of the loss of soil biodiversity.
The Global Soil Biodiversity Atlas raises awareness of the role of
soil organisms in sustaining life on our planet, and presents the
latest research on soil biodiversity. It is also a major contribution
to the EU target of halting the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem
services in the EU by 2020, and the goals of the 2030 Agenda
for Sustainable Development on sustainable food production and
fighting land degradation.
This publication marks a crucial step towards a global
coordinated effort to assess life below ground, and highlights
the need to improve soil conservation and the diversity of life within it.},

However, most traditional soil carbon models are lacking in terms of the representation of key microbial processes that control the soil carbon response to global climate change. In this study, the improved process-based model TRIPLEX-GHG was developed by coupling it with the new MEND (Microbial-ENzyme-mediated Decomposition) model to estimate total global soil organic carbon (SOC) and global soil microbial carbon. The new model (TRIPLEX-MICROBE) shows considerable improvement over the previous version (TRIPLEX-GHG) in simulating SOC. We estimated the global soil carbon stock to be approximately 1195 Pg C, with 348 Pg C located in the high northern latitudes, which is in good agreement with the well-regarded Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD) and the Northern Circumpolar Soil Carbon Database (NCSCD). We also estimated the global soil microbial carbon to be 21 Pg C, similar to the 23 Pg C estimated. We found that the microbial carbon quantity in the latitudinal direction showed reversions at approximately 30°N, near the equator and at 25°S. A sensitivity analysis suggested that the tundra ecosystem exhibited the highest sensitivity to a 1°C increase or decrease in temperature in terms of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and mineral-associated organic carbon (MOC). Furthermore, our work represents the first step towards a new generation of ecosystem process models capable of integrating key microbial processes into soil carbon cycles.},

	abstract = {Our understanding of the biology, biochemistry, and genetic development of roots has considerably improved during the last decade (Smith and Fedoroff, 1995; Flores et al., 1999;Benfey and Scheres, 2000). In contrast, the processes mediated by roots in the rhizosphere such as the secretion of root border cells and root exudates are not yet well understood (Hawes et al., 2000). In addition to the classical roles of providing mechanical support and allowing water/nutrient uptake, roots also perform certain specialized roles, including the ability to synthesize, accumulate, and secrete a diverse array of compounds (Flores et al., 1999). Given the complexity and biodiversity of the underground world, roots are clearly not passive targets for soil organisms. Rather, the compounds secreted by plant roots serve important roles as chemical attractants and repellants in the rhizosphere, the narrow zone of soil immediately surrounding the root system (Estabrook and Yoder, 1998; Bais et al., 2001). The chemicals secreted into the soil by roots are broadly referred to as root exudates. Through the exudation of a wide variety of compounds, roots may regulate the soil microbial community in their immediate vicinity, cope with herbivores, encourage beneficial symbioses, change the chemical and physical properties of the soil, and inhibit the growth of competing plant species (Nardi et al., 2000; Fig. 1A). The ability to secrete a vast array of compounds into the rhizosphere is one of the most remarkable metabolic features of plant roots, with nearly 5\% to 21\% of all photosynthetically fixed carbon being transferred to the rhizosphere through root exudates (Marschner, 1995).Fig. 1.A, Representation of the complex interactions mediated by root exudates that take place in the rhizosphere between plant roots and other organisms.

	abstract = {Lorenz Hiltner is recognized as the first scientist to coin the term “rhizosphere” in 1904. His scientific career and achievements are summarized in this essay. Most of his research he performed in the Bavarian Agriculture–Botanical Institute (later named the “Bavarian Institute of Plant Growth and Plant Protection”) in Munich, where he was the director from 1902 to 1923. Beginning with intensive and thorough investigations on the germination and growth of different crop plants (legumes and non-legumes) Hiltner became convinced, that root exudates of different plants support the development of different bacterial communities. His definition of the “rhizosphere” in the year 1904 centered on the idea, that plant nutrition is considerably influenced by the microbial composition of the rhizosphere. Hiltner observed bacterial cells even inside the rhizodermis of healthy roots. In analogy with fungal root symbionts, Hiltner named the bacterial community that is closely associated with roots “bacteriorhiza.” In his rhizosphere concept, Hiltner also envisioned, that beneficial bacteria are not only attracted by the root exudates but that there are also “uninvited guests,” that adjust to the specific root exudates. Based on his observations he hypothesized that “the resistance of plants towards pathogenesis is dependent on the composition of the rhizosphere microflora.” He even had the idea, that the quality of plant products may be dependent on the composition of the root microflora. In addition to his scientific achievements, Hiltner was very dedicated to applied work. Together with F. Nobbe he had the first patent on Rhizobium inoculants (Nitragin). He continuously improved formulations and the effectivity of the Rhizobium preparations and he also initiated seed dressing with sublimate for plant protection of seedlings. Thus, Hiltner tightly linked breakthroughs in basic research to improved rhizosphere management practices. In addition, he wrote a pioneering monograph on plant protection for everybody’s practical use. His emphasis on understanding microbes in the context of their micro-habitat, the rhizosphere, made him a pioneer in microbial ecology. Even now, in the era of genome and postgenome analysis with our better understanding of plant nutrition and soil bacteriology, his ideas and contributions are as fresh as they were more than 100 years ago.},

In addition, membrane potential changes were also determined at chosen JG concentrations. It was found that JG, when added to the incubation medium, inhibited endogenous growth as well as growth in the presence of either IAA or FC. Simultaneous measurements of growth and external pH indicated that inhibition of either IAA-induced growth or proton extrusion by JG was a linear function of JG concentration. Addition of JG to the control medium caused depolarization of the membrane potential (Em), value of which was dependent on JG concentration and time after its administration. Hyperpolarization of Em induced by IAA was suppressed in the presence of JG. It was also found that for coleoptile segments initially preincubated with JG, although subsequently removed, addition of IAA was not effective in the stimulation of growth and medium acidification. Taken together, these results suggest that the mechanism by which JG inhibits the IAA-induced growth of maize coleoptile segments involves inhibition of PM H+-ATPase activity.},

Normal fibroblast were found to be especially sensitive to juglone and lost viability primarily through a rapid apoptotic and necrotic response. This response may have been triggered by DNA damage since juglone induced a rapid and strong phosphorylation of H2AX in all phases of the cell cycle. Furthermore, juglone inhibits mRNA synthesis in human fibroblasts in a dose-dependent manner. Surprisingly, juglone caused a drastic reduction of the basal level of p53 in human fibroblasts and this loss could not be fully rescued by proteasome and calpain I inhibitors. However, when cells were pretreated with UV light or ionizing radiation, juglone was not able to reduce the cellular levels of activated p53. Our results show that juglone has multiple effects on cells such as the induction of DNA damage, inhibition of transcription, reduction of p53 protein levels and the induction of cell death.},

Low therapeutic index and resistance to pharmacotherapy are two of the major limits of antitumour treatments. Natural products represent an excellent library of bioactive molecules. Thus, tapping into the natural world may prove useful in identifying new therapeutic options with favourable pharmaco-toxicological profiles. Juglans regia, or common walnut, is a very resilient tree that has inhabited our planet for thousands of years. Many studies correlate walnut consumption to beneficial effects towards several chronic diseases, such as cancer, mainly due to the bioactive molecules stored in different parts of the plant. Among others, polyphenols, quinones, proteins, and essential fatty acids contribute to its pharmacologic activity. The present review aims to offer a comprehensive perspective about the antitumour potential of the most promising compounds stored in this plant, such as juglanin, juglone, and the ellagitannin-metabolites urolithins or deriving from walnut dietary intake. All molecules and a chronic intake of the fruit provide tangible anticancer effects. However, the scarcity of studies on humans does not allow results to be conclusive.},

In addition to their function in plant defence against pests and diseases above-ground, benzoxazinoids (BXs) have also been implicated in defence below-ground, where they can exert allelochemical or antimicrobial activities. We have studied the impact of BXs on the interaction between maize and Pseudomonas putida KT2440, a competitive coloniser of the maize rhizosphere with plant-beneficial traits. Chromatographic analyses revealed that DIMBOA is the main BX compound in root exudates of maize. In vitro analysis of DIMBOA stability indicated that KT2440 tolerance of DIMBOA is based on metabolism-dependent breakdown of this BX compound. Transcriptome analysis of DIMBOA-exposed P. putida identified increased transcription of genes controlling benzoate catabolism and chemotaxis. Chemotaxis assays confirmed motility of P. putida towards DIMBOA. Moreover, colonisation essays in soil with Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)-expressing P. putida showed that DIMBOA-producing roots of wild-type maize attract significantly higher numbers of P. putida cells than roots of the DIMBOA-deficient bx1 mutant. Our results demonstrate a central role for DIMBOA as a below-ground semiochemical for recruitment of plant-beneficial rhizobacteria during the relatively young and vulnerable growth stages of maize.},

In this critical zone, plants perceive and respond to their environment. As a consequence of normal growth and development, a large range of organic and inorganic substances are exchanged between the root and soil, which inevitably leads to changes in the biochemical and physical properties of the rhizosphere. Plants also modify their rhizosphere in response to certain environmental signals and stresses. Organic anions are commonly detected in this region, and their exudation from plant roots has now been associated with nutrient deficiencies and inorganic ion stresses. This review summarizes recent developments in the understanding of the function, mechanism, and regulation of organic anion exudation from roots. The benefits that plants derive from the presence of organic anions in the rhizosphere are described and the potential for biotechnology to increase organic anion exudation is highlighted.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Root exudation is an important process determining plant interactions with the soil environment. Many studies have linked this process to soil nutrient mobilization. Yet, it remains unresolved how exudation is controlled and how exactly and under what circumstances plants benefit from exudation. The majority of root exudates including primary metabolites (sugars, amino acids, and organic acids) are believed to be passively lost from the root and used by rhizosphere-dwelling microbes. In this review, we synthetize recent advances in ecology and plant biology to explain and propose mechanisms by which root exudation of primary metabolites is controlled, and what role their exudation plays in plant nutrient acquisition strategies. Specifically, we propose a novel conceptual framework for root exudates. This framework is built upon two main concepts: (1) root exudation of primary metabolites is driven by diffusion, with plants and microbes both modulating concentration gradients and therefore diffusion rates to soil depending on their nutritional status; (2) exuded metabolite concentrations can be sensed at the root tip and signals are translated to modify root architecture. The flux of primary metabolites through root exudation is mostly located at the root tip, where the lack of cell differentiation favors diffusion of metabolites to the soil. We show examples of how the root tip senses concentration changes of exuded metabolites and translates that into signals to modify root growth. Plants can modify the concentration of metabolites either by controlling source/sink processes or by expressing and regulating efflux carriers, therefore challenging the idea of root exudation as a purely unregulated passive process. Through root exudate flux, plants can locally enhance concentrations of many common metabolites, which can serve as sensors and integrators of the plant nutritional status and of the nutrient availability in the surrounding environment. Plant-associated micro-organisms also constitute a strong sink for plant carbon, thereby increasing concentration gradients of metabolites and affecting root exudation. Understanding the mechanisms of and the effects that environmental stimuli have on the magnitude and type of root exudation will ultimately improve our knowledge of processes determining soil CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ emissions, ecosystem functioning, and how to improve the sustainability of agricultural production.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The loss of organic and inorganic carbon from roots into soil underpins nearly all the major changes that occur in the rhizosphere. In this review we explore the mechanistic basis of organic carbon and nitrogen flow in the rhizosphere. It is clear that C and N flow in the rhizosphere is extremely complex, being highly plant and environment dependent and varying both spatially and temporally along the root. Consequently, the amount and type of rhizodeposits (e.g. exudates, border cells, mucilage) remains highly context specific. This has severely limited our capacity to quantify and model the amount of rhizodeposition in ecosystem processes such as C sequestration and nutrient acquisition. It is now evident that C and N flow at the soil–root interface is bidirectional with C and N being lost from roots and taken up from the soil simultaneously. Here we present four alternative hypotheses to explain why high and low molecular weight organic compounds are actively cycled in the rhizosphere. These include: (1) indirect, fortuitous root exudate recapture as part of the root’s C and N distribution network, (2) direct re-uptake to enhance the plant’s C efficiency and to reduce rhizosphere microbial growth and pathogen attack, (3) direct uptake to recapture organic nutrients released from soil organic matter, and (4) for inter-root and root–microbial signal exchange. Due to severe flaws in the interpretation of commonly used isotopic labelling techniques, there is still great uncertainty surrounding the importance of these individual fluxes in the rhizosphere. Due to the importance of rhizodeposition in regulating ecosystem functioning, it is critical that future research focuses on resolving the quantitative importance of the different C and N fluxes operating in the rhizosphere and the ways in which these vary spatially and temporally.},

	abstract = {Viruses play important roles in biogeochemical nutrient cycles and act as genomic reservoirs in marine and freshwater environments, the understanding of which brought about the so-called ‘third age’ of virus ecology in aquatic environments. Unfortunately, the third age is in oceanography and limnology and outside the soil world. The main reason why virus ecology in soils has shown less progress is that agronomical and epidemiological interests were the primary motivation of viral studies by soil microbiologists. In this review, past research on viruses in soils is summarized after the introduction of the ecological traits of viruses, which are the effects of viruses on beneficial bacteria and soil-borne plant pathogens, adsorption of viruses to soils, and soil factors affecting viral inactivation and survival in soils. Horizontal gene transfer (transduction) in soils is also reviewed. Second, the abundance of viruses and their roles in biogeochemical nutrient cycles are summarized in aquatic environments. Five to 25\% of the carbon fixed by primary producers is estimated to enter into the microbial loop via virus-induced lysis at different trophic levels in aquatic environments. The diversity of virus communities in aquatic environments estimated from analyses of the frequency distribution of capsid sizes and the morphology of virus populations are reviewed, and recent findings on the genomic diversity of viruses and their roles as the greatest genomic reservoirs in aquatic environments follow in the subsequent section. Viral genomics is elucidating the viral diversity and phylogenetic relationships among viruses in different environments. As the soil environment is a more diverse habitat for viruses than aquatic environments, viruses in soils have great potential to play roles comparable in quantity, which are unique in quality, to those in aquatic environments. Therefore, the potentiality and characteristics of viruses in soils are discussed in the final section for future research on virus ecology in soils from the viewpoints of biogeochemistry and genomic diversity. Synecological approaches to viruses in soils may open up a new era of soil virus ecology.},

	abstract = {Viruses are ubiquitous in nature and have various ecological functions. Despite their very high abundance (up to 1010 g−1), viruses in soil remain disregarded with just a few, mostly descriptive studies published to date. With this review we focus on the probable functioning of viruses in soil and the consequences for microbial life and turnover, related mechanisms of biogeochemical cycling of carbon (C) and nutrients, and long-term C stabilization. We draw on the limited literature for soil, the richer knowledge from aquatic ecosystems and sediments, and evidence from pure culture studies. Evidence from soil and other ecosystems indicate that the vast majority of soil bacteria are infected by phages at any time. Consequently, we introduce and adapt five concepts for the role of phages in soil: (1) Viral Shunt, (2) ‘Forever Young’, (3) Viral Regulatory Gate of EXOMET, (4) C sequestration by microbial necromass stabilization, and (5) Microscale divergence of C/N/P stoichiometry. The ‘Viral Shunt’ accounts for the short-circuiting of trophic C and nutrient transfers by virus-induced mortality. Phages (even without soil animals – the Microbial Loop concept) explain bacterial death rates and the release of easily available C and nutrients, consequently accelerating biogeochemical cycles in soil. The concept ‘Forever Young’ postulates that viral infection maintains the active bacterial population at a young age, because infection and lysis lead to a short life expectancy. We controversially discuss this concept in relation to hypotheses such as (1) the dormancy of most soil microorganisms, (2) maintenance energy for microorganisms, and (3) their high C use efficiency. We unify the previously suggested but unexplained concepts of ‘Regulatory Gate’ and ‘EXOMET’ through the lytic release of intracellular enzymes and metabolites. Due to the elemental composition of phages, infection results in Stoichiometric C/N/P Imbalances at the microscale, with consequences for P limitation at macroscales. The recently developed concept of ‘C Sequestration by Necromass Stabilization’, i.e., that C sequestered in soil derives from microbial necromass, is discussed from the new perspective of viral lysis and “entombment” of cell fragments in nano-pores. Very few studies have investigated viruses in soil, so all research directions are open, important and fascinating. The most urgent are those elucidating virus functions, their consequences for microbial life, and ecological relevance, and to confirm (or to reject) the proposed concepts. Functioning very fast at the nano-scale, the undead drivers govern microbial life in soil and biogeochemical turnover from micro to ecosystem scales.},

	abstract = {Viruses are the most abundant biological entities in the world, but their ecological functions in soil are virtually unknown. We hypothesized that greater abundance of T4-like phages will increase bacterial death and thereby suppress soil organic carbon (SOC) mineralization. A range of phage and bacterial abundances were established in sterilized soil by reinoculation with 10–3 and 10–6 dilutions of suspensions of unsterilized soil. The total and viable 16S rRNA gene abundance (a universal marker for bacteria) was measured by qPCR to determine bacterial abundance, with propidium monoazide (PMA) preapplication to eliminate DNA from non-viable cells. Abundance of the g23 marker gene was used to quantify T4-like phages. A close negative correlation between g23 abundance and viable 16S rRNA gene abundance was observed. High abundance of g23 led to lower viable ratios for bacteria, which suggested that phages drove microbial necromass production. The CO2 efflux from soil increased with bacterial abundance but decreased with higher abundance of T4-like phages. Elimination of extracellular DNA by PMA strengthened the relationship between CO2 efflux and bacterial abundance, suggesting that SOC mineralization by bacteria is strongly reduced by the T4-like phages. A random forest model revealed that abundance of T4-like phages and the abundance ratio of T4-like phages to bacteria are better predictors of SOC mineralization (measured as CO2 efflux) than bacterial abundance. Our study provides experimental evidence of phages’ role in organic matter turnover in soil: they can retard SOC decomposition but accelerate bacterial turnover.},

	abstract = {Rapidly thawing permafrost harbors ∼30 to 50\% of global soil carbon, and the fate of this carbon remains unknown. Microorganisms will play a central role in its fate, and their viruses could modulate that impact via induced mortality and metabolic controls. Because of the challenges of recovering viruses from soils, little is known about soil viruses or their role(s) in microbial biogeochemical cycling. Here, we describe 53 viral populations (viral operational taxonomic units [vOTUs]) recovered from seven quantitatively derived (i.e., not multiple-displacement-amplified) viral-particle metagenomes (viromes) along a permafrost thaw gradient at the Stordalen Mire field site in northern Sweden. Only 15\% of these vOTUs had genetic similarity to publicly available viruses in the RefSeq database, and ∼30\% of the genes could be annotated, supporting the concept of soils as reservoirs of substantial undescribed viral genetic diversity. The vOTUs exhibited distinct ecology, with different distributions along the thaw gradient habitats, and a shift from soil-virus-like assemblages in the dry palsas to aquatic-virus-like assemblages in the inundated fen. Seventeen vOTUs were linked to microbial hosts (in silico), implicating viruses in infecting abundant microbial lineages from Acidobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and Deltaproteobacteria, including those encoding key biogeochemical functions such as organic matter degradation. Thirty auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) were identified and suggested virus-mediated modulation of central carbon metabolism, soil organic matter degradation, polysaccharide binding, and regulation of sporulation. Together, these findings suggest that these soil viruses have distinct ecology, impact host-mediated biogeochemistry, and likely impact ecosystem function in the rapidly changing Arctic. IMPORTANCE This work is part of a 10-year project to examine thawing permafrost peatlands and is the first virome-particle-based approach to characterize viruses in these systems. This method yielded {\textgreater}2-fold-more viral populations (vOTUs) per gigabase of metagenome than vOTUs derived from bulk-soil metagenomes from the same site (J. B. Emerson, S. Roux, J. R. Brum, B. Bolduc, et al., Nat Microbiol 3:870-880, 2018, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-018-0190-y). We compared the ecology of the recovered vOTUs along a permafrost thaw gradient and found (i) habitat specificity, (ii) a shift in viral community identity from soil-like to aquatic-like viruses, (iii) infection of dominant microbial hosts, and (iv) carriage of host metabolic genes. These vOTUs can impact ecosystem carbon processing via top-down (inferred from lysing dominant microbial hosts) and bottom-up (inferred from carriage of auxiliary metabolic genes) controls. This work serves as a foundation which future studies can build upon to increase our understanding of the soil virosphere and how viruses affect soil ecosystem services.},

	abstract = {The finding that total viral abundance is higher than total prokaryotic abundance and that a significant fraction of the prokaryotic community is infected with phages in aquatic systems has stimulated research on the ecology of prokaryotic viruses and their role in ecosystems. This review treats the ecology of prokaryotic viruses (‘phages’) in marine, freshwater and soil systems from a ‘virus point of view’. The abundance of viruses varies strongly in different environments and is related to bacterial abundance or activity suggesting that the majority of the viruses found in the environment are typically phages. Data on phage diversity are sparse but indicate that phages are extremely diverse in natural systems. Lytic phages are predators of prokaryotes, whereas lysogenic and chronic infections represent a parasitic interaction. Some forms of lysogeny might be described best as mutualism. The little existing ecological data on phage populations indicate a large variety of environmental niches and survival strategies. The host cell is the main resource for phages and the resource quality, i.e., the metabolic state of the host cell, is a critical factor in all steps of the phage life cycle. Virus-induced mortality of prokaryotes varies strongly on a temporal and spatial scale and shows that phages can be important predators of bacterioplankton. This mortality and the release of cell lysis products into the environment can strongly influence microbial food web processes and biogeochemical cycles. Phages can also affect host diversity, e.g., by ‘killing the winner’ and keeping in check competitively dominant species or populations. Moreover, they mediate gene transfer between prokaryotes, but this remains largely unknown in the environment. Genomics or proteomics are providing us now with powerful tools in phage ecology, but final testing will have to be performed in the environment.},

This pool is dynamic, and the transfer of genetic material between hosts and their phages probably influences the genetic and functional diversity of both. For example, photosynthesis genes of cyanobacterial origin have been found in phages that infect Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus, the numerically dominant phototrophs in ocean ecosystems. These genes include psbA, which encodes the photosystem II core reaction centre protein D1, and high-light-inducible (hli) genes. Here we show that phage psbA and hli genes are expressed during infection of Prochlorococcus and are co-transcribed with essential phage capsid genes, and that the amount of phage D1 protein increases steadily over the infective period. We also show that the expression of host photosynthesis genes declines over the course of infection and that replication of the phage genome is a function of photosynthesis. We thus propose that the phage genes are functional in photosynthesis and that they may be increasing phage fitness by supplementing the host production of these proteins.},

In this state, the bacteria carrying the prophage is at risk of superinfection, where another phage injects its genetic material and competes for host cell resources. To avoid this, many phages have evolved mechanisms that alter the bacteria and make it resistant to phage superinfection. The mechanisms underlying these phentoypic conversions and the fitness consequences for the host are poorly understood, and systematic studies of superinfection exclusion mechanisms are lacking. In this study, we examined a wide range of Pseudomonas aeruginosa phages and found that they mediate superinfection exclusion through a variety of mechanisms, some of which affected the type IV pilus and O-antigen, and others that functioned inside the cell. The strongest resistance mechanism was a surface modification that we showed is cost-free for the bacterial host in a natural soil environment and in a Caenorhabditis. elegans infection model. This study represents the first systematic approach to address how a population of prophages influences phage resistance and bacterial behavior in P. aeruginosa.},

	abstract = {A widespread system used by bacteria for protection against potentially dangerous foreign DNA molecules consists of the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) coupled with cas (CRISPR-associated) genes. Similar to RNA interference in eukaryotes, these CRISPR/Cas systems use small RNAs for sequence-specific detection and neutralization of invading genomes. Here we describe the first examples of genes that mediate the inhibition of a CRISPR/Cas system. Five distinct 'anti-CRISPR' genes were found in the genomes of bacteriophages infecting Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Mutation of the anti-CRISPR gene of a phage rendered it unable to infect bacteria with a functional CRISPR/Cas system, and the addition of the same gene to the genome of a CRISPR/Cas-targeted phage allowed it to evade the CRISPR/Cas system. Phage-encoded anti-CRISPR genes may represent a widespread mechanism for phages to overcome the highly prevalent CRISPR/Cas systems. The existence of anti-CRISPR genes presents new avenues for the elucidation of CRISPR/Cas functional mechanisms and provides new insight into the co-evolution of phages and bacteria.},

Here we report results that, together with those in the literature5,6, show that DMSP and its breakdown products (DMS, acrylate, dimethylsulphoxide, and methane sulphinic acid) readily scavenge hydroxyl radicals and other reactive oxygen species, and thus may serve as an antioxidant system, regulated in part by enzymatic cleavage of DMSP. In support of this hypothesis, we found that oxidative stressors, solar ultraviolet radiation7, CO2 limitation8, Fe limitation, high Cu2+ (ref. 9) and H2O2 substantially increased cellular DMSP and/or its lysis to DMS in marine algal cultures. Our results indicate direct links between such stressors and the dynamics of DMSP and DMS in marine phytoplankton, which probably influence the production of DMS and its release to the atmosphere. As oxidation of DMS to sulphuric acid in the atmosphere provides a major source of sulphate aerosols and cloud condensation nuclei3, oxidative stressors—including solar radiation and Fe limitation—may be involved in complex ocean–atmosphere feedback loops that influence global climate and hydrological cycles1,2.},

Our analyses revealed four ecological zones, latitudinal and depth diversity patterns, and environmental correlates for RNA viruses. Our findings only partially parallel those of cosampled plankton and show unexpectedly high polar ecological interactions. The influence of RNA viruses on ecosystems appears to be large, as predicted hosts are ecologically important. Moreover, the occurrence of auxiliary metabolic genes indicates that RNA viruses cause reprogramming of diverse host metabolisms, including photosynthesis and carbon cycling, and that RNA virus abundances predict ocean carbon export.},

Less clear is how temperate viruses, which coexist and replicate with their host, influence microbial communities. Here we show that virus-like particles are relatively less abundant at high host densities. This suggests suppressed lysis where established models predict lytic dynamics are favoured. Meta-analysis of published viral and microbial densities showed that this trend was widespread in diverse ecosystems ranging from soil to freshwater to human lungs. Experimental manipulations showed viral densities more consistent with temperate than lytic life cycles at increasing microbial abundance. An analysis of 24 coral reef viromes showed a relative increase in the abundance of hallmark genes encoded by temperate viruses with increased microbial abundance. Based on these four lines of evidence, we propose the Piggyback-the-Winner model wherein temperate dynamics become increasingly important in ecosystems with high microbial densities; thus 'more microbes, fewer viruses'.},

Owing to the advent of metagenomics and viromics approaches, an ever-increasing diversity of virus-encoded auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) have been identified in soils, including those involved in the transformation of carbon, phosphorus, and sulfur, degradation of organic pollutants, and antibiotic resistance, among other processes. These viral AMGs can alter soil biogeochemical processes and metabolic activities by interfering with bacterial host metabolism. It is recognized that viral AMGs compensate for host bacterial metabolism outputs by encoding accessory functional genes and are favourable for the hosts' adaptation to stressed soil environments. The eco-evolutionary mechanisms behind this fascinating diversity of viral AMGs in soil microbiomes have begun to emerge, such as horizontal gene transfer, lytic-lysogenic conversion, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms. In this mini-review, we summarize recent advances in the diversity and function of virus-encoded AMGs in the soil environment, especially focusing on the evolutionary significance of AMGs involved in virus-host interactions. This mini-review also sheds light on the existing gaps and future perspectives that could have major significance for viral AMGs research in soils.},

Over the past decade, various photosynthesis-related genes have been found in viruses that infect cyanobacteria (cyanophages). Although photosystem II (PSII) genes are common in both cultured cyanophages and environmental samples 1-4 , viral photosystem I (vPSI) genes have so far only been detected in environmental samples 5,6 . Here, we have used a targeted strategy to isolate a cyanophage from the tropical Pacific Ocean that carries a PSI gene cassette with seven distinct PSI genes (psaJF, C, A, B, K, E, D) as well as two PSII genes (psbA, D). This cyanophage, P-TIM68, belongs to the T4-like myoviruses, has a prolate capsid, a long contractile tail and infects Prochlorococcus sp. strain MIT9515. Phage photosynthesis genes from both photosystems are expressed during infection, and the resultant proteins are incorporated into membranes of the infected host. Moreover, photosynthetic capacity in the cell is maintained throughout the infection cycle with enhancement of cyclic electron flow around PSI. Analysis of metagenomic data from the Tara Oceans expedition 7 shows that phages carrying PSI gene cassettes are abundant in the tropical Pacific Ocean, composing up to 28\% of T4-like cyanomyophages. They are also present in the tropical Indian and Atlantic Oceans. P-TIM68 populations, specifically, compose on average 22\% of the PSI-gene-cassette carrying phages. Our results suggest that cyanophages carrying PSI and PSII genes are likely to maintain and even manipulate photosynthesis during infection of their Prochlorococcus hosts in the tropical oceans.},

	abstract = {Cyanophages infecting the marine cyanobacteria Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus encode and express genes for the photosynthetic light reactions. Sequenced cyanophage genomes lack Calvin cycle genes, however, suggesting that photosynthetic energy harvested via phage proteins is not used for carbon fixation. We report here that cyanophages carry and express a Calvin cycle inhibitor, CP12, whose host homologue directs carbon flux from the Calvin cycle to the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Phage CP12 was coexpressed with phage genes involved in the light reactions, deoxynucleotide biosynthesis, and the PPP, including a transaldolase gene that is the most prevalent PPP gene in cyanophages. Phage transaldolase was purified to homogeneity from several strains and shown to be functional in vitro, suggesting that it might facilitate increased flux through this key reaction in the host PPP, augmenting production of NADPH and ribose 5-phosphate. Kinetic measurements of phage and host transaldolases revealed that the phage enzymes have kcat/Km values only approximately one third of the corresponding host enzymes. The lower efficiency of phage transaldolase may be a tradeoff for other selective advantages such as reduced gene size: we show that more than half of host-like cyanophage genes are significantly shorter than their host homologues. Consistent with decreased Calvin cycle activity and increased PPP and light reaction activity under infection, the host NADPH/NADP ratio increased two-fold in infected cells. We propose that phage-augmented NADPH production fuels deoxynucleotide biosynthesis for phage replication, and that the selection pressures molding phage genomes involve fitness advantages conferred through mobilization of host energy stores.},

	abstract = {Cyanophages (cyanobacterial viruses) are important agents of horizontal gene transfer among marine cyanobacteria, the numerically dominant photosynthetic organisms in the oceans. Some cyanophage genomes carry and express host-like photosynthesis genes, presumably to augment the host photosynthetic machinery during infection. To study the prevalence and evolutionary dynamics of this phenomenon, 33 cultured cyanophages of known family and host range and viral DNA from field samples were screened for the presence of two core photosystem reaction center genes, psbA and psbD. Combining this expanded dataset with published data for nine other cyanophages, we found that 88\% of the phage genomes contain psbA, and 50\% contain both psbA and psbD. The psbA gene was found in all myoviruses and Prochlorococcus podoviruses, but could not be amplified from Prochlorococcus siphoviruses or Synechococcus podoviruses. Nearly all of the phages that encoded both psbA and psbD had broad host ranges. We speculate that the presence or absence of psbA in a phage genome may be determined by the length of the latent period of infection. Whether it also carries psbD may reflect constraints on coupling of viral- and host-encoded PsbA–PsbD in the photosynthetic reaction center across divergent hosts. Phylogenetic clustering patterns of these genes from cultured phages suggest that whole genes have been transferred from host to phage in a discrete number of events over the course of evolution (four for psbA, and two for psbD), followed by horizontal and vertical transfer between cyanophages. Clustering patterns of psbA and psbD from Synechococcus cells were inconsistent with other molecular phylogenetic markers, suggesting genetic exchanges involving Synechococcus lineages. Signatures of intragenic recombination, detected within the cyanophage gene pool as well as between hosts and phages in both directions, support this hypothesis. The analysis of cyanophage psbA and psbD genes from field populations revealed significant sequence diversity, much of which is represented in our cultured isolates. Collectively, these findings show that photosynthesis genes are common in cyanophages and that significant genetic exchanges occur from host to phage, phage to host, and within the phage gene pool. This generates genetic diversity among the phage, which serves as a reservoir for their hosts, and in turn influences photosystem evolution.},

Here we present a meta-analysis of microbial community samples collected by hundreds of researchers for the Earth Microbiome Project. Coordinated protocols and new analytical methods, particularly the use of exact sequences instead of clustered operational taxonomic units, enable bacterial and archaeal ribosomal RNA gene sequences to be followed across multiple studies and allow us to explore patterns of diversity at an unprecedented scale.

To estimate the prevalence of lysogeny within soil bacterial communities, induction assays were carried out by extracting bacteria from soil and subsequently exposing extracts to mitomycin C (MC; 0.5 microg ml(-1)), or by exposing bacteria to MC (1.0 microg ml(-1)) through direct addition to soil slurries. Induction was assessed as an increase in viral direct counts relative to those obtained in controls, as detected by epifluorescence microscopy. Extracting bacteria from soils followed by 18 h MC exposure generated significantly higher prophage induction than all other treatments (P {\textless} 0.05). For three Antarctic soil samples, estimates of inducible fraction (IF) were statistically indistinguishable across two independent assays (P = 0.82), indicating that this approach is highly reproducible. Although IF was lower in Antarctic soils (4-20\%) and higher in temperate Delaware soils (22-68\%), no clear correlations were found between lysogeny and soil physical properties. For Delaware soils, IF estimates were similar between whole soil assays (44\%) and cultivation-based approaches (30\%). While these data suggest that lysogeny is common among soil bacteria, the specific factors which promote temperate interactions remain unclear.},

We express and functionally screen several chitosanase genes identified from environmental metagenomes. One expressed protein showing endo-chitosanase activity (V-Csn) is crystalized and structurally characterized at ultra-high resolution, thus representing the structure of a soil viral AMG product. This structure provides details about the active site, and together with structure models determined using AlphaFold, facilitates understanding of substrate specificity and enzyme mechanism.

The role of viruses, which are known to affect microbial dynamics, metabolism and biogeochemistry in the oceans8–10, remains largely unexplored in soil. Here, we aimed to investigate how viruses influence microbial ecology and carbon metabolism in peatland soils along a permafrost thaw gradient in Sweden. We recovered 1,907 viral populations (genomes and large genome fragments) from 197 bulk soil and size-fractionated metagenomes, 58\% of which were detected in metatranscriptomes and presumed to be active. In silico predictions linked 35\% of the viruses to microbial host populations, highlighting likely viral predators of key carbon-cycling microorganisms, including methanogens and methanotrophs. Lineage-specific virus/host ratios varied, suggesting that viral infection dynamics may differentially impact microbial responses to a changing climate. Virus-encoded glycoside hydrolases, including an endomannanase with confirmed functional activity, indicated that viruses influence complex carbon degradation and that viral abundances were significant predictors of methane dynamics. These findings suggest that viruses may impact ecosystem function in climate-critical, terrestrial habitats and identify multiple potential viral contributions to soil carbon cycling.},

Evidence for retention of AMGs during niche-differentiation of diverse phage populations provided evidence that auxiliary metabolism imparts measurable fitness benefits to phages with ramifications for ecosystem biogeochemistry. Gene abundance and expression profiles of AMGs suggested significant contributions by phages to sulfur and thiosulfate oxidation in freshwater lakes and oceans, and a sensitive response to changing sulfur concentrations in hydrothermal environments. Overall, our study provides fundamental insights on the distribution, diversity, and ecology of phage auxiliary metabolism associated with sulfur and reinforces the necessity of incorporating viral contributions into biogeochemical configurations.},

	abstract = {During the first half of the twentieth century, many scientists considered viruses the smallest living entities and primitive life forms somehow placed between the inert world and highly evolved cells. The development of molecular biology in the second half of the century showed that viruses are strict molecular parasites of cells, putting an end to previous virocentric debates that gave viruses a primeval role in the origin of life. Recent advances in comparative genomics and metagenomics have uncovered a vast viral diversity and have shown that viruses are active regulators of cell populations and that they can influence cell evolution by acting as vectors for gene transfer among cells. They have also fostered a revival of old virocentric ideas. These ideas are heterogeneous, extending from proposals that consider viruses functionally as living beings and/or as descendants of viral lineages that preceded cell evolution to other claims that consider viruses and/or some viral families a fourth domain of life. In this article, we revisit these virocentric ideas and analyze the place of viruses in biology in light of the long-standing dichotomic debate between metabolist and geneticist views which hold, respectively, that self-maintenance (metabolism) or self-replication and evolution are the primeval features of life. We argue that whereas the epistemological discussion about whether viruses are alive or not and whether some virus-like replicators precede the first cells is a matter of debate that can be understood within the metabolism-versus-genes dialectic; the claim that viruses form a fourth domain in the tree of life can be solidly refuted by proper molecular phylogenetic analyses and needs to be removed from this debate.},

Here, we review lysogeny from molecular mechanisms to ecological patterns to emerging approaches of investigation. Our goal is to highlight both its diversity and importance in complex communities.

Beef extract and glycine buffer were the most effective in eluting viable phages inoculated into soils (up to 29\% recovery); however, extraction efficiency varied significantly with phage strain. Potassium citrate eluted the highest numbers of virus-like particles from both soils based on enumerations by EFM (mean, 5.3 x 10(8) g of dry soil(-1)), but specific soil-eluant combinations posed significant problems to enumeration by EFM. Observations of virus-like particles under TEM gave confidence that the particles were, in fact, phages, but TEM enumerations yielded measurements of phage abundance (mean, 1.5 x 10(8) g of dry soil(-1)) that were about five times lower.

The diverse environmental factors which induce this state, and the variety of bacteria which have been shown to enter into the VBNC state, are listed. In recent years, a great amount of research has revealed what occurs in cells as they enter and exist in this state, and these studies are also detailed. The ability of cells to resuscitate from the VBNC state and return to an actively metabolizing and culturable form is described, as well as the ability of these cells to retain virulence. Finally, the question of why cells become nonculturable is addressed.

In this study, we investigated factors controlling the balance between viral production and decay along a trophic gradient in the north Adriatic basin, providing independent estimates of these variables and determining the relative importance of nanoflagellate grazing and viral life strategies. Increasing trophic conditions induced an increase of bacterioplankton growth rates and of the burst sizes. As a result, eutrophic waters displayed highest rates of viral production, which considerably exceeded observed rates of viral decay (up to 2.9 x 10(9) VLP liter(-1) h(-1)). Viral decay was also higher in eutrophic waters, where it accounted for ca. 40\% of viral production, and dropped significantly to 1.3 to 10.7\% in oligotrophic waters. These results suggest that viral production and decay rates may not necessarily be balanced in the short term, resulting in a net increase of viruses in the system. In eutrophic waters nanoflagellate grazing, dissolved-colloidal substances, and lysogenic infection were responsible together for the removal of ca. 66\% of viral production versus 17\% in oligotrophic waters. Our results suggest that different causative agents are primarily responsible for the removal of viruses from the water column in different trophic conditions. Factors other than those considered in the past might shed light on processes responsible for the removal and/or decay of viral particles from the water column.},

	abstract = {The effect of glutathione (GSH) on the ultraviolet (UV) induction of lambda prophage was investigated in lysogenic Escherichia coli. The data showed that extracellular GSH could inhibit the UV induction of lambda prophage. The inhibitory rates were concentration dependent, and the maximal rate obtained was 94\% with 3.0 M GSH. The effect was also measured in three different lambda lysogens: a wild-type strain (wt), an isogenic GSH-deficient strain, and an isogenic strain producing increased amounts of GSH. The result showed that when subjected to UV irradiation (254 nm, 60 J m(-2)), GSH-deficient strain was approximately fivefold more sensitive to be lysed than wt, whereas the strain with higher intracellular GSH levels was only 28\% susceptible to be lysed. With electron spin resonance and spin trapping techniques, we observed that free radical signals occurred in the suspensions of UV irradiated lysogenic cells and the intensity of signals was influenced by GSH levels. These results indicate that GSH can significantly inhibit the UV induction of lambda prophage, and that this effect is correlated to its capacity to scavenge free radicals generated after UV irradiation.},

	abstract = {Temperate viruses can become dormant in their host cells, a process called lysogeny. In every infection, such viruses decide between the lytic and the lysogenic cycles, that is, whether to replicate and lyse their host or to lysogenize and keep the host viable. Here we show that viruses (phages) of the SPbeta group use a small-molecule communication system to coordinate lysis-lysogeny decisions. During infection of its Bacillus host cell, the phage produces a six amino-acids-long communication peptide that is released into the medium. In subsequent infections, progeny phages measure the concentration of this peptide and lysogenize if the concentration is sufficiently high. We found that different phages encode different versions of the communication peptide, demonstrating a phage-specific peptide communication code for lysogeny decisions. We term this communication system the 'arbitrium' system, and further show that it is encoded by three phage genes: aimP, which produces the peptide; aimR, the intracellular peptide receptor; and aimX, a negative regulator of lysogeny. The arbitrium system enables a descendant phage to 'communicate' with its predecessors, that is, to estimate the amount of recent previous infections and hence decide whether to employ the lytic or lysogenic cycle.},

	abstract = {The biogechemical cycles of carbon and sulfur contain within them the principles processes that control the level of atmospheric oxygen over Phanerozoic time. These are the production, deposition, burial and eventual oxidative weathering of organic matter and the diagenetic formation, burial and eventual oxidative weathering of sedimentary pyrite. Observations of modern sedimentary environments indicate that: (1) most organic matter, on a worldwide basis, is deposited in marine shelf-deltaic sediments, rather than in high-productivity upwelling regions or anoxic basins; (2) burial rate and the degree of preservation of organic matter are positively correlated with total sedimentation rate; (3) the rate of decomposition of organic matter in natural waters and sediments is highly dependent on the source and degree of aging of the organic matter itself, and is largely unaffected by the concentration of the principal oxidants, O2 and SO42-; (4) pyrite sulfur concentration in normal marine environments correlates well with organic carbon concentration due to the limitation of bacterial sulfate reduction by reactive organic matter that escapes aerobic destruction during deposition and bioturbation; (5) depth-integrated sulfate reduction in normal marine sediments correlates positively with total sedimentation rate; (6) in euxinic sediments excess pyrite is formed from sulfidic bottomwaters leading to a lack of correlation between organic carbon and pyrite sulfur, a good correlation between pyrite sulfur and total iron, and high degrees of pyritization of iron; and (7) very low concentrations of pyrite are found in continental fresh water sediments, regardless of organic matter or iron content, due to limitation of pyrite formation by the low concentration of dissolved sulfate in fresh water. Through the use of carbon and sulfur isotope mass balance models, it is possible to calculate original rates of burial of organic carbon (C) and pyrite sulfur (S) over Phanerozoic time. Unusually high calculated rates of organic carbon burial during Permo-Carboniferous time are attributed to: (1) the rise of vascular plants on the continents; (2) the availability of vast flooded lowlands (swamps) on the emergent continent of Pangea where deposited organic matter could be preserved; and (3) the high C/P ratio of vascular plant material which enabled greater organic carbon burial, per unit of phosphorus burial, than was the case previously for marine organic matter. High C/S ratios for Permo-Carboniferous time are attributed to a large proportion of total worldwide organic matter burial occurring in fresh water swamps and lakes. Low C/S ratios for the early Paleozoic are attributed to a much greater abundance of euxinic basins than at present and to the lack of deposition of vascular plant-derived organic matter at that time. There is little doubt that atmospheric O2 has varied over Phanerozoic time. However, straightforward calculation of atmospheric O2 levels, from rates of organic matter burial etc. derived from the isotope mass balance models, leads to geologically unreasonable fluctuations, even when linear O2 negative feedback is introduced to the modelling. There is a need for additional quantifiable and geologically reasonable feedback mechanisms that constrain the modeling of atmospheric O2 variation. Three possible candidates discussed here are: (1) splitting of the reservoirs of materials undergoing weathering into old and young sub-reservoirs, which enables rapid isotope recycling via more rapid weathering of younger rocks; (2) changing rates of worldwide erosion and total sediments burial which simultaneously enables variations in O2 production, due to changes in burial rates of organic matter and pyrite, and in O2 consumption, due to changes in rates of exposure of organic matter and pyrite to oxidative weathering; and (3) changing the stoichiometry of O2 uptake during weathering by making it dependent on atmospheric O2 level.},

To our knowledge, no study has compared the diversities of the four major microbial taxa, i.e., bacteria, archaea, fungi, and viruses, from an individual soil sample. We used metagenomic and small-subunit RNA-based sequence analysis techniques to compare the estimated richness and evenness of these groups in prairie, desert, and rainforest soils. By grouping sequences at the 97\% sequence similarity level (an operational taxonomic unit [OTU]), we found that the archaeal and fungal communities were consistently less even than the bacterial communities. Although total richness levels are difficult to estimate with a high degree of certainty, the estimated number of unique archaeal or fungal OTUs appears to rival or exceed the number of unique bacterial OTUs in each of the collected soils. In this first study to comprehensively survey viral communities using a metagenomic approach, we found that soil viruses are taxonomically diverse and distinct from the communities of viruses found in other environments that have been surveyed using a similar approach. Within each of the four microbial groups, we observed minimal taxonomic overlap between sites, suggesting that soil archaea, bacteria, fungi, and viruses are globally as well as locally diverse.},

Phage-encoded VqmA (VqmAPhage) binds to host-produced DPO, launching the phage lysis program via an antirepressor that inactivates the phage repressor by sequestration. The antirepressor interferes with repressors from related phages. Like phage VP882, these phages encode DNA-binding proteins and partner antirepressors, suggesting that they, too, integrate host-derived information into their lysis-lysogeny decisions. VqmAPhage activates the host VqmAVc regulon, whereas VqmAVc cannot induce phage-mediated lysis, suggesting an asymmetry whereby the phage influences host QS while enacting its own lytic-lysogeny program without interference. We reprogram phages to activate lysis in response to user-defined cues.

The order Caudovirales was the predominant viral type in agricultural soils, with Siphoviridae being the most abundant family. Phylogenetic analysis of the terminase large subunit of Caudovirales identified high viral diversity and three novel groups. Viral community composition differed significantly between bulk and rhizosphere soils. Soil pH was the main environmental driver of the viral community structure. Remarkably, abundant auxiliary carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZyme) genes were detected in viromes, including glycoside hydrolases, carbohydrate esterases and carbohydrate-binding modules. These results demonstrate that virus-encoded putative auxiliary metabolic genes or metabolic genes that may change bacterial metabolism and indirectly contribute to biogeochemical cycling, especially carbon cycling, in agricultural soil.},

Fifty-one of the 82 such genomes published to date carry prophages, and these contain 230 recognizable putative prophages.

Many of these prophages appear to be defective and are in a state of mutational decay. Prophages, including defective ones, can contribute important biological properties to their bacterial hosts. Therefore, if we are to comprehend bacterial genomes fully, it is essential that we are able to recognize accurately and understand their prophages from nucleotide sequence analysis. Analysis of the evolution of prophages can shed light on the evolution of both bacteriophages and their hosts. Comparison of the Rac prophages in the sequenced genomes of three Escherichia coli strains and the Pnm prophages in two Neisseria meningitidis strains suggests that some prophages can lie in residence for very long times, perhaps millions of years, and that recombination events have occurred between related prophages that reside at different locations in a bacterium's genome. In addition, many genes in defective prophages remain functional, so a significant portion of the temperate bacteriophage gene pool resides in prophages.},

Using a global soil respiration data set, we developed a climate-driven model of soil respiration by modifying and updating Raich's model, and the global spatiotemporal distribution of soil respiration was examined using this model. The model was applied at a spatial resolution of 0.5°and a monthly time step. Soil respiration was divided into the heterotrophic and autotrophic components of respiration using an empirical model. The estimated mean annual global soil respiration was 91 Pg C yr−1 (between 1965 and 2012; Monte Carlo 95 \% confidence interval: 87–95 Pg C yr−1) and increased at the rate of 0.09 Pg C yr−2. The contribution of soil respiration from boreal regions to the total increase in global soil respiration was on the same order of magnitude as that of tropical and temperate regions, despite a lower absolute magnitude of soil respiration in boreal regions. The estimated annual global heterotrophic respiration and global autotrophic respiration were 51 and 40 Pg C yr−1, respectively. The global soil respiration responded to the increase in air temperature at the rate of 3.3 Pg C yr−1 °C−1, and Q10 = 1.4. Our study scaled up observed soil respiration values from field measurements to estimate global soil respiration and provide a data-oriented estimate of global soil respiration. The estimates are based on a semi-empirical model parameterized with over one thousand data points. Our analysis indicates that the climate controls on soil respiration may translate into an increasing trend in global soil respiration and our analysis emphasizes the relevance of the soil carbon flux from soil to the atmosphere in response to climate change. Further approaches should additionally focus on climate controls in soil respiration in combination with changes in vegetation dynamics and soil carbon stocks, along with their effects on the long temporal dynamics of soil respiration. We expect that these spatiotemporal estimates will provide a benchmark for future studies and also help to constrain process-oriented models.},

However, a global, quantitative view of how the biomass of different taxa compare with one another is still lacking. Here, we assemble the overall biomass composition of the biosphere, establishing a census of the ≈550 gigatons of carbon (Gt C) of biomass distributed among all of the kingdoms of life. We find that the kingdoms of life concentrate at different locations on the planet; plants (≈450 Gt C, the dominant kingdom) are primarily terrestrial, whereas animals (≈2 Gt C) are mainly marine, and bacteria (≈70 Gt C) and archaea (≈7 Gt C) are predominantly located in deep subsurface environments. We show that terrestrial biomass is about two orders of magnitude higher than marine biomass and estimate a total of ≈6 Gt C of marine biota, doubling the previous estimated quantity. Our analysis reveals that the global marine biomass pyramid contains more consumers than producers, thus increasing the scope of previous observations on inverse food pyramids. Finally, we highlight that the mass of humans is an order of magnitude higher than that of all wild mammals combined and report the historical impact of humanity on the global biomass of prominent taxa, including mammals, fish, and plants.},

However, little is known about the patterns and drivers of viral community composition, particularly in soil, precluding a predictive understanding of viral impacts on terrestrial habitats. To investigate soil viral community assembly processes, here we analyzed 43 soil viromes from a rainfall manipulation experiment in a Mediterranean grassland in California. We identified 5,315 viral populations (viral operational taxonomic units [vOTUs] with a representative sequence ≥10 kbp) and found that viral community composition exhibited a highly significant distance–decay relationship within the 200-m2 field site. This pattern was recapitulated by the intrapopulation microheterogeneity trends of prevalent vOTUs (detected in ≥90\% of the viromes), which tended to exhibit negative correlations between spatial distance and the genomic similarity of their predominant allelic variants. Although significant spatial structuring was also observed in the bacterial and archaeal communities, the signal was dampened relative to the viromes, suggesting differences in local assembly drivers for viruses and prokaryotes and/or differences in the temporal scales captured by viromes and total DNA. Despite the overwhelming spatial signal, evidence for environmental filtering was revealed in a protein-sharing network analysis, wherein a group of related vOTUs predicted to infect actinobacteria was shown to be significantly enriched in low-moisture samples distributed throughout the field. Overall, our results indicate a highly diverse, dynamic, active, and spatially structured soil virosphere capable of rapid responses to changing environmental conditions.},

It is usually assumed that mortality is due to protozoan grazing3,4 rather than to viral infection, probably because abundances of phage and host in nature are presumed to be low5. Previously, either very few marine bacteriophages have been found by plaque assays6–9, or viruses have been simply observed10–12or counted13,14 by transmission electron microscopy, with the assumption that 'phage-looking' forms are locally active bacteriophages. Here we report not only high viral abundance in the ocean but also counts of bacteria and cyanobacteria in the final irreversible stage of lytic infection. The latter counts are necessary to evaluate mortality, because the sources, hosts, viability and ages of observed free viruses are unknown; even finding viruses attached to cells does not prove successful infection. Up to 7\% of the heterotrophic bacteria and 5\% of the cyanobacteria from diverse marine locations contained mature phage; interpretation via culture data indicates that up to 70\% of the prokaryotes could be infected. These data demonstrate the existence of a significant new pathway of carbon and nitrogen cycling in marine food webs and have further implications for gene transfer between marine organisms.},

Attempts to detect the presence of these concentrations of H2S have always failed and, more important, the ocean surface waters are much too oxidizing to permit the existence of H2S at concentrations sufficient to sustain an atmospheric equilibrium concentration of 2×10−10 by volume. Many elements form volatile methyl derivatives; Challenger5 reported that many living systems produced dimethyl sulphide (DMS), and that prominent among them were marine algae.

	doi = {10.1186/s40168-021-01156-0},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Peatlands are expected to experience sustained yet fluctuating higher temperatures due to climate change, leading to increased microbial activity and greenhouse gas emissions. Despite mounting evidence for viral contributions to these processes in peatlands underlain with permafrost, little is known about viruses in other peatlands. More generally, soil viral biogeography and its potential drivers are poorly understood at both local and global scales. Here, 87 metagenomes and five viral size-fraction metagenomes (viromes) from a boreal peatland in northern Minnesota (the SPRUCE whole-ecosystem warming experiment and surrounding bog) were analyzed for dsDNA viral community ecological patterns, and the recovered viral populations (vOTUs) were compared with our curated PIGEON database of 266,125 vOTUs from diverse ecosystems.
RESULTS: Within the SPRUCE experiment, viral community composition was significantly correlated with peat depth, water content, and carbon chemistry, including CH4 and CO2 concentrations, but not with temperature during the first 2 years of warming treatments. Peat vOTUs with aquatic-like signatures (shared predicted protein content with marine and/or freshwater vOTUs) were significantly enriched in more waterlogged surface peat depths. Predicted host ranges for SPRUCE vOTUs were relatively narrow, generally within a single bacterial genus. Of the 4326 SPRUCE vOTUs, 164 were previously detected in other soils, mostly peatlands. None of the previously identified 202,371 marine and freshwater vOTUs in our PIGEON database were detected in SPRUCE peat, but 0.4\% of 80,714 viral clusters (VCs, grouped by predicted protein content) were shared between soil and aquatic environments. On a per-sample basis, vOTU recovery was 32 times higher from viromes compared with total metagenomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest strong viral "species" boundaries between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and to some extent between peat and other soils, with differences less pronounced at higher taxonomic levels. The significant enrichment of aquatic-like vOTUs in more waterlogged peat suggests that viruses may also exhibit niche partitioning on more local scales. These patterns are presumably driven in part by host ecology, consistent with the predicted narrow host ranges. Although more samples and increased sequencing depth improved vOTU recovery from total metagenomes, the substantially higher per-sample vOTU recovery after viral particle enrichment highlights the utility of soil viromics.

	abstract = {Northern peatlands have accumulated large stocks of organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), but their spatial distribution and vulnerability to climate warming remain uncertain. Here, we used machine-learning techniques with extensive peat core data (n {\textgreater} 7,000) to create observation-based maps of northern peatland C and N stocks, and to assess their response to warming and permafrost thaw. We estimate that northern peatlands cover 3.7 ± 0.5 million km2 and store 415 ± 150 Pg C and 10 ± 7 Pg N. Nearly half of the peatland area and peat C stocks are permafrost affected. Using modeled global warming stabilization scenarios (from 1.5 to 6 °C warming), we project that the current sink of atmospheric C (0.10 ± 0.02 Pg C⋅y-1) in northern peatlands will shift to a C source as 0.8 to 1.9 million km2 of permafrost-affected peatlands thaw. The projected thaw would cause peatland greenhouse gas emissions equal to ∼1\% of anthropogenic radiative forcing in this century. The main forcing is from methane emissions (0.7 to 3 Pg cumulative CH4-C) with smaller carbon dioxide forcing (1 to 2 Pg CO2-C) and minor nitrous oxide losses. We project that initial CO2-C losses reverse after ∼200 y, as warming strengthens peatland C-sinks. We project substantial, but highly uncertain, additional losses of peat into fluvial systems of 10 to 30 Pg C and 0.4 to 0.9 Pg N. The combined gaseous and fluvial peatland C loss estimated here adds 30 to 50\% onto previous estimates of permafrost-thaw C losses, with southern permafrost regions being the most vulnerable.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mangroves are ecologically and economically important forests of the tropics. As one of the most carbon-rich biomes, mangroves account for 11\% of the total input of terrestrial carbon into oceans. Although viruses are considered to significantly influence local and global biogeochemical cycles, little information is available regarding the community structure, genetic diversity and ecological roles of viruses in mangrove ecosystems.
METHODS: Here, we utilised viral metagenomics sequencing and virome-specific bioinformatics tools to study viral communities in six mangrove soil samples collected from different mangrove habitats in Southern China.
RESULTS: Mangrove soil viruses were found to be largely uncharacterised. Phylogenetic analyses of the major viral groups demonstrated extensive diversity and previously unknown viral clades and suggested that global mangrove viral communities possibly comprise evolutionarily close genotypes. Comparative analysis of viral genotypes revealed that mangrove soil viromes are mainly affected by marine waters, with less influence coming from freshwaters. Notably, we identified abundant auxiliary carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZyme) genes from mangrove viruses, most of which participate in biolysis of complex polysaccharides, which are abundant in mangrove soils and organism debris. Host prediction results showed that viral CAZyme genes are diverse and probably widespread in mangrove soil phages infecting diverse bacteria of different phyla.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that mangrove viruses are diverse and probably directly manipulate carbon cycling by participating in biomass recycling of complex polysaccharides, providing the knowledge essential in revealing the ecological roles of viruses in mangrove ecosystems.},

In the era of large scale sequencing and high-throughput Biology, it is important to examine the position of this specialist database that is deeply rooted in human curation. The three primary tasks of the CAZy curators are (i) to maintain and update the family classification of this class of enzymes, (ii) to classify sequences newly released by GenBank and the Protein Data Bank and (iii) to capture and present functional information for each family. The CAZy website is updated once a month. Here we briefly summarize the increase in novel families and the annotations conducted during the last 8 years. We present several important changes that facilitate taxonomic navigation, and allow to download the entirety of the annotations. Most importantly we highlight the considerable amount of work that accompanies the analysis and report of biochemical data from the literature.},

Through an enormous experimental effort1-4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence-the structure prediction component of the 'protein folding problem'8-has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10-14, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

Chitosan is usually prepared by a thermochemical method, consuming time, energy and reagents. In this review, various methods of chitosan extraction will be approached and compared; the importance of a new method of ecological extraction will be emphasized. Moreover, in order to improve the chitosan functionality, and better control these physicochemical properties, several chemical modifications have been reported.

The use of CRISPR–Cas9 as an RNA-programmable DNA targeting and editing platform is simplified by a synthetic single-guide RNA (sgRNA) mimicking the natural dual trans-activating CRISPR RNA (tracrRNA)–CRISPR RNA (crRNA) structure.

After transcription of the CRISPR, a complex of Cas proteins termed Cascade cleaves a CRISPR RNA precursor in each repeat and retains the cleavage products containing the virus-derived sequence. Assisted by the helicase Cas3, these mature CRISPR RNAs then serve as small guide RNAs that enable Cascade to interfere with virus proliferation. Our results demonstrate that the formation of mature guide RNAs by the CRISPR RNA endonuclease subunit of Cascade is a mechanistic requirement for antiviral defense.},

The continuous enhancement of these tools has led to a revolution in the life sciences, which promises to deliver novel therapies for genetic disease. Precise genome-editing can be traced back to the 1950s with the discovery of DNA’s double-helix and, after 70 years of development, has evolved from crude in vitro applications to a wide range of sophisticated capabilities, including in vivo applications. Nonetheless, precise genome-editing faces constraints such as modest efficiency, delivery challenges, and off-target effects. In this review, we explore precise genome-editing, with a focus on introduction of the landmark events in its history, various platforms, delivery systems, and applications. First, we discuss the landmark events in the history of precise genome-editing. Second, we describe the current state of precise genome-editing strategies and explain how these techniques offer unprecedented precision and versatility for modifying the human genome. Third, we introduce the current delivery systems used to deploy precise genome-editing components through DNA, RNA, and RNPs. Finally, we summarize the current applications of precise genome-editing in labeling endogenous genes, screening genetic variants, molecular recording, generating disease models, and gene therapy, including ex vivo therapy and in vivo therapy, and discuss potential future advances.},

DPO is made from threonine and alanine, and its synthesis depends on threonine dehydrogenase (Tdh). DPO binds to and activates a transcription factor, VqmA. The VqmA-DPO complex activates expression of vqmR, which encodes a small regulatory RNA. VqmR represses genes required for biofilm formation and toxin production.

The constant threat of phage predation has led to the evolution of a broad range of bacterial immunity mechanisms that in turn result in the evolution of diverse phage immune evasion strategies, leading to a dynamic co-evolutionary arms race. Although bacterial innate immune mechanisms against phage abound, the only documented bacterial adaptive immune system is the CRISPR/Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated proteins) system, which provides sequence-specific protection from invading nucleic acids, including phage. Here we show a remarkable turn of events, in which a phage-encoded CRISPR/Cas system is used to counteract a phage inhibitory chromosomal island of the bacterial host. A successful lytic infection by the phage is dependent on sequence identity between CRISPR spacers and the target chromosomal island. In the absence of such targeting, the phage-encoded CRISPR/Cas system can acquire new spacers to evolve rapidly and ensure effective targeting of the chromosomal island to restore phage replication.},

	abstract = {CRISPR-Cas systems are host-encoded pathways that protect microbes from viral infection using an adaptive RNA-guided mechanism. Using genome-resolved metagenomics, we find that CRISPR systems are also encoded in diverse bacteriophages, where they occur as divergent and hypercompact anti-viral systems. Bacteriophage-encoded CRISPR systems belong to all six known CRISPR-Cas types, though some lack crucial components, suggesting alternate functional roles or host complementation. We describe multiple new Cas9-like proteins and 44 families related to type V CRISPR-Cas systems, including the Casλ RNA-guided nuclease family. Among the most divergent of the new enzymes identified, Casλ recognizes double-stranded DNA using a uniquely structured CRISPR RNA (crRNA). The Casλ-RNA-DNA structure determined by cryoelectron microscopy reveals a compact bilobed architecture capable of inducing genome editing in mammalian, Arabidopsis, and hexaploid wheat cells. These findings reveal a new source of CRISPR-Cas enzymes in phages and highlight their value as genome editors in plant and human cells.},

Lysogenic conversion, for example, can improve host fitness and lead to phage-mediated horizontal gene transfer. However, little is known about lysogeny and transduction in the soil environment. In this study we employed atrazine-impregnated Bio-Sep beads (a cell immobilization matrix) to sample active microbiota from soils with prior pesticide exposure history. Once recovered from soil, the bead communities were induced with mitomycin C (MC), and viral and bacterial abundances were determined to evaluate the incidence of inducible prophage in soil bacteria. The inducible fraction calculated within bead communities was high (ca. 85\%) relative to other studies in aquatic and sedimentary environments. Moreover, the bacterial genes encoding 16S rRNA and trzN, a chlorohydrolase gene responsible for dehalogenation of atrazine, were detected by PCR in the viral DNA fraction purified from MC-induced bead communities. A diverse collection of actinobacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences occurred within the viral DNA fraction of induced, water-equilibrated beads. Similar results were observed in induced atrazine-equilibrated beads, where 77\% of the cloned sequences were derived from actinobacterial lineages. Heterogeneous 16S rRNA gene sequences consisting of fragments from two different taxa were detected in the clone libraries. The results suggest that lysogeny is a prevalent reproductive strategy among soil bacteriophages and that the potential for horizontal gene transfer via transduction is significant in soil microbial communities.},

In the human pathogen, Staphylococcus aureus, prophages are omnipresent and are believed to be responsible for the spread of some antibiotic resistance genes. Here we demonstrate that release of phages from a subpopulation of S. aureus cells enables the intact, prophage-containing population to acquire beneficial genes from competing, phage-susceptible strains present in the same environment. Phage infection kills competitor cells and bits of their DNA are occasionally captured in viral transducing particles. Return of such particles to the prophage-containing population can drive the transfer of genes encoding potentially useful traits such as antibiotic resistance. This process, which can be viewed as ‘auto-transduction’, allows S. aureus to efficiently acquire antibiotic resistance both in vitro and in an in vivo virulence model (wax moth larvae) and enables it to proliferate under strong antibiotic selection pressure. Our results may help to explain the rapid exchange of antibiotic resistance genes observed in S. aureus.},

Because temperate bacteriophages are vastly abundant and greatly diverse, they are rich resources for understanding the mechanisms and evolution of switches and the molecular control of genetic circuitry. Here, we describe a new class of small, compact, and simple switches that use site-specific recombination as the key decision point. The phage attachment site attP is located within the phage repressor gene such that chromosomal integration results in removal of a C-terminal tag that destabilizes the virally encoded form of the repressor. Integration thus not only confers prophage stability but also is a requirement for lysogenic establishment. The variety of these self-contained integration-dependent immunity systems in different genomic contexts suggests that these represent ancestral states in switch evolution from which more-complex switches have evolved. They also provide a powerful toolkit for building synthetic biological circuits.},

In this paper we review the current state of research on the SOS response outside E. coli . By retracing research on the identification of multiple diverging LexA-binding motifs across the Bacteria Domain, we show how this work has led to the description of a minimum regulon core, but also of a heterogeneous collection of SOS regulatory networks that challenges many tenets of the E. coli model. We also review recent attempts at reconstructing the evolutionary history of the SOS network that have cast new light on the SOS response. Exploiting the newly gained knowledge on LexA-binding motifs and the tight association of LexA with a recently described mutagenesis cassette, these works put forward likely evolutionary scenarios for the SOS response, and we discuss their relevance on the ultimate nature of this stress-response system and the evolutionary pressures driving its evolution.},

While a few auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) in bacteriophages from aquatic habitats are reported to have the potential to enhance P-acquisition ability of their hosts, little is known about the diversity and potential ecological function of P-acquisition genes encoded by terrestrial bacteriophages. Here, we analyze 333 soil metagenomes from five terrestrial habitat types across China and identify 75 viral operational taxonomic units (vOTUs) that encode 105 P-acquisition AMGs. These AMGs span 17 distinct functional genes involved in four primary processes of microbial P-acquisition. Among them, over 60\% (11/17) have not been reported previously. We experimentally verify in-vitro enzymatic activities of two pyrophosphatases and one alkaline phosphatase encoded by P-acquisition vOTUs. Thirty-six percent of the 75 P-acquisition vOTUs are detectable in a published global topsoil metagenome dataset. Further analyses reveal that, under certain circumstances, the identified P-acquisition AMGs have a greater influence on soil P availability and are more dominant in soil metatranscriptomes than their corresponding bacterial genes.

Some fundamental advantages of viruses, compared to synthetically programmed materials, include the highly precise spatial arrangement of their subunits into a diverse array of shapes and sizes and many available avenues for easy and reproducible modification. Here, we will first survey the broad distribution of viruses and various methods for producing virus-based nanoparticles, as well as engineering principles used to impart new functionalities. We will then examine the broad range of applications and implications of virus-based materials, focusing on the medical, biotechnology, and energy sectors.

It has seen great strides in combating human disease, has given hope to patients and families with limited treatment options, but has also been subject to many setbacks. Treatment of patients with this class of investigational drugs has resulted in severe adverse effects and, even in rare cases, death. At the heart of this dichotomous field are the viral-based vectors, the delivery vehicles that have allowed researchers and clinicians to develop powerful drug platforms, and have radically changed the face of medicine. Within the past 5 years, the gene therapy field has seen a wave of drugs based on viral vectors that have gained regulatory approval that come in a variety of designs and purposes. These modalities range from vector-based cancer therapies, to treating monogenic diseases with life-altering outcomes. At present, the three key vector strategies are based on adenoviruses, adeno-associated viruses, and lentiviruses. They have led the way in preclinical and clinical successes in the past two decades. However, despite these successes, many challenges still limit these approaches from attaining their full potential. To review the viral vector-based gene therapy landscape, we focus on these three highly regarded vector platforms and describe mechanisms of action and their roles in treating human disease.},

From this initial capital of matter, differentiation formed the chemical and physical compartments of core, mantle, continents, ocean and atmosphere, that characterize Earth today. Differentiation was, and still is, driven by energy from various sources including radioactive heat and relic heat from accretion. With evolution of photosynthesis, living organisms acquired the ability to harvest Solar energy and channel it into geochemical cycles. On our present Earth, the primary production from life contributes 3 times more energy to these cycles than Earth's internal heat engine. We hypothesize that the emergence of this energy resource modified Earth's geochemical cycles and ultimately stimulated the production of granite during the earliest Archaean, which led to the first stabilization of continents on Earth. Such biological forcing may explain the unique presence of granite on Earth, and why stable continents did not form during the first half billion years of Earth's history.},

	abstract = {A shift toward higher atmospheric oxygen concentration during the late Proterozoic has been inferred from multiple indirect proxies and is seen by many as a prerequisite for the emergence of complex animal life. However, the mechanisms controlling the level of oxygen throughout the Proterozoic and its eventual rise remain uncertain. Here we use a simple biogeochemical model to show that the balance between long-term carbon removal fluxes via terrestrial silicate weathering and ocean crust alteration plays a key role in determining atmospheric oxygen concentration. This balance may be shifted by changes in terrestrial weatherability or in the generation rate of oceanic crust. As a result, the terrestrial chemical weathering flux may be permanently altered—contrasting with the conventional view that the global silicate weathering flux must adjust to equal the volcanic CO2 degassing flux. Changes in chemical weathering flux in turn alter the long-term supply of phosphorus to the ocean, and therefore the flux of organic carbon burial, which is the long-term source of atmospheric oxygen. Hence we propose that increasing solar luminosity and a decrease in seafloor spreading rate over 1,500–500 Ma drove a gradual shift from seafloor weathering to terrestrial weathering, and a corresponding steady rise in atmospheric oxygen. Furthermore, increased terrestrial weatherability during the late Neoproterozoic may explain low temperature, increases in ocean phosphate, ocean sulfate, and atmospheric oxygen concentration at this time.},

	abstract = {A model of the natural global redox cycle of biospheric carbon is introduced. According to this model, carbon transfer between biosphere and geospheres is accompanied by a conversion of the oxidative forms, presented by CO2, bicarbonate and carbonate ions, into the reduced forms, produced in photosynthesis. The mechanism of carbon transfer is associated with two phases of movement of lithospheric plates. In the short-term orogenic phase, CO2 from the subduction (plates’ collisions) zones fills the “atmosphere–hydrosphere” system, resulting in climate warming. In the long-term quiet (geosynclynal) phase, weathering and photosynthesis become dominant depleting the oxidative forms of carbon. The above asymmetric periodicity exerts an impact on climate, biodiversity, distribution of organic matter in sedimentary deposits, etc. Along with photosynthesis expansion, the redox carbon cycle undergoes its development until it reaches the ecological compensation point, at which CO2 is depleted to the level critical to support the growth and reproduction of plants. This occurred in the Permo-Carboniferous time and in the Neogene. Shorter-term perturbations of the global carbon cycle in the form of glacial–interglacial oscillations appear near the ecological compensation point.},

Much less is known about the magnitude of the energy flows within the climate system and at the Earth surface, which cannot be directly measured by satellites. In addition to satellite observations, here we make extensive use of the growing number of surface observations to constrain the global energy balance not only from space, but also from the surface. We combine these observations with the latest modeling efforts performed for the 5th IPCC assessment report to infer best estimates for the global mean surface radiative components. Our analyses favor global mean downward surface solar and thermal radiation values near 185 and 342 Wm−2, respectively, which are most compatible with surface observations. Combined with an estimated surface absorbed solar radiation and thermal emission of 161 and 397 Wm−2, respectively, this leaves 106 Wm−2 of surface net radiation available globally for distribution amongst the non-radiative surface energy balance components. The climate models overestimate the downward solar and underestimate the downward thermal radiation, thereby simulating nevertheless an adequate global mean surface net radiation by error compensation. This also suggests that, globally, the simulated surface sensible and latent heat fluxes, around 20 and 85 Wm−2 on average, state realistic values. The findings of this study are compiled into a new global energy balance diagram, which may be able to reconcile currently disputed inconsistencies between energy and water cycle estimates.},

	abstract = {Organic acids, such as malate, citrate and oxalate, have been proposed to be involved in many processes operating in the rhizosphere, including nutrient acquisition and metal detoxification, alleviation of anaerobic stress in roots, mineral weathering and pathogen attraction. A full assessment of their role in these processes, however, cannot be determined unless the exact mechanisms of plant organic acid release and the fate of these compounds in the soil are more fully understood. This review therefore includes information on organic acid levels in plants (concentrations, compartmentalisation, spatial aspects, synthesis), plant efflux (passive versus active transport, theoretical versus experimental considerations), soil reactions (soil solution concentrations, sorption) and microbial considerations (mineralization). In summary, the release of organic acids from roots can operate by multiple mechanisms in response to a number of well-defined environmental stresses (e.g., Al, P and Fe stress, anoxia): These responses, however, are highly stress- and plant-species specific. In addition, this review indicates that the sorption of organic acids to the mineral phase and mineralisation by the soil's microbial biomass are critical to determining the effectiveness of organic acids in most rhizosphere processes.},

Initial residence times of these compounds in the soil solution are on the order of hours, with microbial uptake a primary removal mechanism. Through microbial biosynthesis, the dissolved compounds become dominant precursors for formation of stable soil organic carbon. How the chemical class (e.g. sugar) of a dissolved compound influences stabilization in field soils is unknown and predictions from our understanding of microbial metabolism, turnover and identity are contradictory. We show that soil carbon formation, from chronic amendments of dissolved compounds to fertilized and unfertilized grasslands, is 2.4-times greater from a sugar than an amino acid. Formation rates are negatively correlated with respiration rates of the compounds, and positively correlated with their recovery in microbial biomass. These relationships suggest that the efficiency of microbial growth on a compound is positively related to formation rates of soil organic carbon. Fertilization does not alter these findings, but together nitrogen and phosphorus additions reduce soil carbon formation. Our results highlight the need to consider both nutrient enrichment and global-change induced shifts in the form of dissolved root inputs to soils to predict future soil carbon stocks and hence phenomena such as climate warming and food security to which these stock sizes are intimately tied.},

Recent experimental studies show that increased exudate inputs may cause a net loss of soil carbon. This stimulation of microbial carbon mineralization (‘priming’) is commonly rationalized by the assumption that exudates provide a readily bioavailable supply of energy for the decomposition of native soil carbon (co-metabolism). Here we show that an alternate mechanism can cause carbon loss of equal or greater magnitude. We find that a common root exudate, oxalic acid, promotes carbon loss by liberating organic compounds from protective associations with minerals. By enhancing microbial access to previously mineral-protected compounds, this indirect mechanism accelerated carbon loss more than simply increasing the supply of energetically more favourable substrates. Our results provide insights into the coupled biotic–abiotic mechanisms underlying the ‘priming’ phenomenon and challenge the assumption that mineral-associated carbon is protected from microbial cycling over millennial timescales.},

	abstract = {Proper management of soil organic matter (SOM) is needed for maintaining soil fertility and for mitigation of the global increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations and should be informed by knowledge about the sources, spatial organisation and stabilisation processes of SOM. Recently, microbial biomass residues (i.e. necromass) have been identified as a significant source of SOM. Here, we propose that cell wall envelopes of bacteria and fungi are stabilised in soil and contribute significantly to small-particulate SOM formation. This hypothesis is based on the mass balance of a soil incubation experiment with 13C-labelled bacterial cells and on the visualisation of the microbial residues by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM). At the end of a 224-day incubation, 50\% of the biomass-derived C remained in the soil, mainly in the non-living part of SOM (40\% of the added biomass C). SEM micrographs only rarely showed intact cells. Instead, organic patchy fragments of 200–500 nm size were abundant and these fragments were associated with all stages of cell envelope decay and fragmentation. Similar fragments, developed on initially clean and sterile in situ microcosms during exposure to groundwater, provide clear evidence for their formation during microbial growth and surface colonisation. Microbial cell envelope fragments thus contribute significantly to SOM formation. This origin and the related macromolecular architecture of SOM are consistent with most observations on SOM, including the abundance of microbial-derived biomarkers, the low C/N ratio, the water repellency and the stabilisation of biomolecules, which in theory should be easily degradable.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a structure for organo-mineral associations in soils based on recent insights concerning the molecular structure of soil organic matter (SOM), and on extensive published evidence from empirical studies of organo-mineral interfaces. Our conceptual model assumes that SOM consists of a heterogeneous mixture of compounds that display a range of amphiphilic or surfactant-like properties, and are capable of self-organization in aqueous solution. An extension of this self-organizational behavior in solution, we suggest that SOM sorbs to mineral surfaces in a discrete zonal sequence. In the contact zone, the formation of particularly strong organo-mineral associations appears to be favored by situations where either (i) polar organic functional groups of amphiphiles interact via ligand exchange with singly coordinated mineral hydroxyls, forming stable inner-sphere complexes, or (ii) proteinaceous materials unfold upon adsorption, thus increasing adhesive strength by adding hydrophobic interactions to electrostatic binding. Entropic considerations dictate that exposed hydrophobic portions of amphiphilic molecules adsorbed directly to mineral surfaces be shielded from the polar aqueous phase through association with hydrophobic moieties of other amphiphilic molecules. This process can create a membrane-like bilayer containing a hydrophobic zone, whose components may exchange more easily with the surrounding soil solution than those in the contact zone, but which are still retained with considerable force. Sorbed to the hydrophilic exterior of hemimicellar coatings, or to adsorbed proteins, are organic molecules forming an outer region, or kinetic zone, that is loosely retained by cation bridging, hydrogen bonding, and other interactions. Organic material in the kinetic zone may experience high exchange rates with the surrounding soil solution, leading to short residence times for individual molecular fragments. The thickness of this outer region would depend more on input than on the availability of binding sites, and would largely be controlled by exchange kinetics. Movement of organics into and out of this outer region can thus be viewed as similar to a phase-partitioning process. The zonal concept of organo-mineral interactions presented here offers a new basis for understanding and predicting the retention of organic compounds, including contaminants, in soils and sediments.},

	abstract = {Living roots and their rhizodeposits can stimulate microbial activity and soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition up to several folds. This so-called rhizosphere priming effect (RPE) varies widely among plant species possibly due to species-specific differences in the quality and quantity of rhizodeposits and other root functions. However, whether the RPE is influenced by plant inter-species interactions remains largely unexplored, even though these interactions can fundamentally shape plant functions such as carbon allocation and nutrient uptake. In a 60-day greenhouse experiment, we continuously labeled monocultures and mixtures of sunflower, soybean and wheat with 13C-depleted CO2 and partitioned total CO2 efflux released from soil at two stages of plant development for SOM- and root-derived CO2. The RPE was calculated as the difference in SOM-derived CO2 between the planted and the unplanted soil, and was compared among the monocultures and mixtures. We found that the RPE was positive under all plants, ranging from 43\% to 136\% increase above the unplanted control. There were no significant differences in RPE at the vegetative stage. At the flowering stage however, the RPE in the soybean–wheat mixture was significantly higher than those in the sunflower monoculture, the sunflower–wheat mixture, and the sunflower–soybean mixture. These results indicated that the influence of plant inter-specific interactions on the RPE is case-specific and phenology-dependent. To evaluate the intensity of inter-specific effects on priming, we calculated an expected RPE for the mixtures based on the RPE of the monocultures weighted by their root biomass and compared it to the measured RPE under mixtures. At flowering, the measured RPE was significantly lower for the sunflower–wheat mixture than what can be expected from their monocultures, suggesting that RPE was significantly reduced by the inter-species effects of sunflower and wheat. In summary, our results clearly demonstrated that inter-species interactions can significantly modify rhizosphere priming on SOM decomposition.},

We found that rhizodeposition inputs have the highest MAOC formation efficiency (46\%) as compared to roots (9\%) or aboveground inputs (7\%). In addition, rhizodeposition unexpectedly reduced POC formation, likely because it increased decomposition rates of new POC. Conversely, root biomass inputs have the highest POC formation efficiency (19\%). Therefore, rhizodeposition and roots appear to play opposite but complementary roles for building MAOC and POC fractions.},

	abstract = {Managing soil organic matter (SOM) stocks to address global change challenges requires well-substantiated knowledge of SOM behavior that can be clearly communicated between scientists, management practitioners, and policy makers. However, SOM is incredibly complex and requires separation into multiple components with contrasting behavior in order to study and predict its dynamics. Numerous diverse SOM separation schemes are currently used, making cross-study comparisons difficult and hindering broad-scale generalizations. Here, we recommend separating SOM into particulate (POM) and mineral-associated (MAOM) forms, two SOM components that are fundamentally different in terms of their formation, persistence, and functioning. We provide evidence of their highly contrasting physical and chemical properties, mean residence times in soil, and responses to land use change, plant litter inputs, warming, CO2 enrichment, and N fertilization. Conceptualizing SOM into POM versus MAOM is a feasible, well-supported, and useful framework that will allow scientists to move beyond studies of bulk SOM, but also use a consistent separation scheme across studies. Ultimately, we propose the POM versus MAOM framework as the best way forward to understand and predict broad-scale SOM dynamics in the context of global change challenges and provide necessary recommendations to managers and policy makers.},

Physical fractionation achieves a rough separation between plant residues and mineral-associated OM, which makes density or particle-size fractionation a useful pretreatment for further differentiation of functional fractions. A part of the OM in organo-mineral associations resists different chemical treatments, but the data obtained cannot readily be compared among each other, and more research is necessary on the processes underlying resistance to treatments for certain OM components. Studies using physical-fractionation procedures followed by soil-microbiological analyses revealed that organo-mineral associations spatially isolate C sources from soil biota, making quantity and quality of OM in microhabitats an important factor controlling community composition. The distribution and activity of soil microorganisms at organo-mineral surfaces can additionally be modified by faunal activities. Composition of OM in organo-mineral associations is highly variable, with loamy soils having generally a higher contribution of polysaccharides, whereas mineral-associated OM in sandy soils is often more aliphatic. Though highly reactive towards Fe oxide surfaces, lignin and phenolic components are usually depleted in organo-mineral associations. Charred OM associated with the mineral surface contributes to a higher aromaticity in heavy fractions. The relative proportion of OC bound in organo-mineral fractions increases with soil depth. Likewise does the strength of the bonding. Organic molecules sorbed to the mineral surfaces or precipitated by Al are effectively stabilized, indicated by reduced susceptibility towards oxidative attack, higher thermal stability, and lower bioavailability. At higher surface loading, organic C is much better bioavailable, also indicated by little 14C age. In the subsurface horizons of the soils investigated in this study, Fe oxides seem to be the most important sorbents, whereas phyllosilicate surfaces may be comparatively more important in topsoils. Specific surface area of soil minerals is not always a good predictor for C-stabilization potentials because surface coverage is discontinuous. Recalcitrance and accessibility/aggregation seem to determine the turnover dynamics in fast and intermediate cycling OM pools, but for long-term OC preservation the interactions with mineral surfaces, and especially with Fe oxide surfaces, are a major control in all soils investigated here.},

Land management for carbon sequestration is most often informed by bulk soil carbon inventories, without considering the form in which carbon is stored, its capacity, persistency and nitrogen demand. Here, we present coupling of European-wide databases with soil organic matter physical fractionation to determine continental-scale forest and grassland topsoil carbon and nitrogen stocks and their distribution between mineral-associated and particulate organic matter pools. Grasslands and arbuscular mycorrhizal forests store more soil carbon in mineral-associated organic carbon, which is more persistent but has a higher nitrogen demand and saturates. Ectomycorrhizal forests store more carbon in particulate organic matter, which is more vulnerable to disturbance but has a lower nitrogen demand and can potentially accumulate indefinitely. The share of carbon between mineral-associated and particulate organic matter and the ratio between carbon and nitrogen affect soil carbon stocks and mediate the effects of other variables on soil carbon stocks. Understanding the physical distribution of organic matter in pools of mineral-associated versus particulate organic matter can inform land management for nitrogen-efficient carbon sequestration, which should be driven by the inherent soil carbon capacity and nitrogen availability in ecosystems.},

In addition, the phenomena of oligotrophy, cryptic growth, plasmolysis, dormancy and arrested metabolism can all influence the longevity of rhizosphere organisms.

The need to understand the extent, nature, magnitude and reversibility of these changes is urgent given the profound effects that humans are having on the natural world. General ecosystem models, which simulate the dynamics of ecosystems based on a mechanistic representation of ecological processes, provide one novel way to project ecosystem changes across all scales and trophic levels, and to forecast impact thresholds beyond which irreversible changes may occur. We model ecosystem changes in four terrestrial biomes subjected to human removal of plant biomass, such as occurs through agricultural land-use change. We find that irreversible, non-linear responses commonly occur where removal of vegetation exceeds 80\% (a level that occurs across nearly 10\% of the Earth’s land surface), especially for organisms at higher trophic levels and in less productive ecosystems. Very large, irreversible changes to ecosystem structure are expected at levels of vegetation removal akin to those in the most intensively used real-world ecosystems. Our results suggest that the projected twenty-first century rapid increases in agricultural land conversion may lead to widespread trophic cascades and in some cases irreversible changes to ecosystem structure.},

	abstract = {Land use conversions can strongly impact soil organic matter (SOM) storage, which creates paramount opportunities for sequestering atmospheric carbon into the soil. It is known that land uses such as annual cropping and afforestation can decrease and increase SOM, respectively; however, the rates of these changes over time remain elusive. This study focused on extracting the kinetics (k) of turnover rates that describe these long-term changes in soil C storage and also quantifying the sources of soil C. We used topsoil organic carbon density and δ13C isotopic composition data from multiple chronosequences and paired sites in Russia and United States. Reconstruction of soil C storage trajectory over 250 years following conversion from native grassland to continual annual cropland revealed a C depletion rate of 0.010 yr−1 (first-order k rate constant), which translates into a mean residence time (MRT) of 100 years (R2≥0.90). Conversely, soil C accretion was observed over 70 years following afforestation of annual croplands at a much faster k rate of 0.055 yr−1. The corresponding MRT was only 18 years (R2=0.997) after a lag phase of 5 years. Over these 23 years of afforestation, trees contributed 14 Mg C ha−1 to soil C accrual in the 0 to 15 cm depth increment. This tree-C contribution reached 22 Mg C ha−1 at 70 years after tree planting. Over these 70 years of afforestation, the proportion of tree C to whole-soil C increased to reach a sizable 79 \%. Furthermore, assuming steady state of soil C in the adjacent croplands, we also estimated that 45 \% of the prairie C existent at the time of tree planting was still present in the afforested soils 70 years later. As an intrinsic property of k modeling, the derived turnover rates that represent soil C changes over time are nonlinear. Soil C changes were much more dynamic during the first decades following a land use conversion than afterwards when the new land use system approached equilibrium. Collectively, results substantiated that C sequestration in afforested lands is a suitable means to proactively mitigate escalating climate change within a typical person's lifetime, as indicated by MRTs of a few decades.},

The clearing of the world's forests, mainly for agricultural uses, releases large amounts of carbon to the atmosphere (up to 2 x 1015 gyr-1), much of which arises from the cultivation driving an accelerated decomposition of soil organic matter. Although the effects of cultivation on soil carbon are well studied, studies of soil-carbon recovery after cultivation are limited. Here we present a four-decade-long field study of carbon accumulation by pine ecosystems established on previously cultivated soils in South Carolina, USA. Newly accumulated carbon is tracked by its distinctive 14C signature, acquired around the onset of forest growth from thermonuclear bomb testing that nearly doubled atmospheric 14CO2 in the 1960s. Field data combined with model simulations indicate that the young aggrading forest rapidly incorporated bomb radiocarbon into the forest floor and the upper 60 cm of underlying mineral soil. By the 1990s, however, carbon accumulated only in forest biomass, forest floor, and the upper 7.5 cm of the mineral soil. Although the forest was a strong carbon sink, trees accounted for about 80\%, the forest floor 20\%, and mineral soil \&lt;1\%, of the carbon accretion. Despite high carbon inputs to the mineral soil, carbon sequestration was limited by rapid decomposition, facilitated by the coarse soil texture and low-activity clay mineralogy.},

	abstract = {Conceptual models suggest that stability of organic carbon (OC) in soil depends on the source of plant litter, occlusion within aggregates, incorporation in organo-mineral complexes, and location within the soil profile. Density fractionation is a useful tool to study the relevance of OC stabilization in aggregates and in association with minerals, but it has rarely been applied to full soil profiles. We aim to determine factors shaping the depth profiles of physically unprotected and mineral associated OC and test their relevance for OC stability across a range of European soils that vary in vegetation, soil types, parent material, and land use. At each of the 12 study sites, 10 soil cores were sampled to 60 cm depth and subjected to density separation. Bulk soil samples and density fractions (free light fractions – fLF, occluded light fractions – oLF, heavy fractions – HF) were analysed for OC, total nitrogen (TN), \&delta;14C, and \&Delta;14C. Bulk samples were also incubated to determine CO2 evolution per g OC in the samples (specific mineralization rates) as an indicator for OC stability. 

 Depth profiles of OC in the light fraction (LF-OC) matched those of roots for undisturbed grassland and forest sites, suggesting that roots are shaping the depth distribution of LF-OC. Organic C in the HF declined less with soil depth than LF-OC and roots, especially at grassland sites. The decrease in \&Delta;14C (increase in age) of HF-OC with soil depth was related to soil pH as well as to dissolved OC fluxes. This indicates that dissolved OC translocation contributes to the formation of subsoil HF-OC and shapes the \&Delta;14C profiles. 

 The LF at three sites were rather depleted in 14C, indicating the presence of fossil material such as coal and lignite, probably inherited from the parent material. At the other sites, modern \&Delta;14C signatures and positive correlations between specific mineralization rates and fLF-OC indicate the fLF is a potentially available energy and nutrient source for subsurface microorganisms throughout the profile. Declining specific mineralization rates with soil depth confirm greater stability of OC in subsoils across sites. The overall importance of OC stabilization by binding to minerals was demonstrated by declining specific mineralization rates with increasing contributions of HF-OC to bulk soil OC, and the low \&Delta;14C values of HF-OC. The stability of HF-OC was greater in subsoils than in topsoils; nevertheless, a portion of HF-OC was active throughout the profile. While quantitatively less important than OC in the HF, consistent older ages of oLF-OC than fLF-OC suggest that occlusion of LF-OC in aggregates also contributes to OC stability in subsoils. Overall, our results indicate that association with minerals is the most important factor in stabilization of OC in soils, irrespective of vegetation, soil type, and land use.},

Global carbon models assume that carbon cycling in upland soils is entirely driven by aerobic respiration; the impact of anaerobic microsites prevalent even within well-drained soils is missed within this conception. Here, we show that anaerobic microsites are important regulators of soil carbon persistence, shifting microbial metabolism to less efficient anaerobic respiration, and selectively protecting otherwise bioavailable, reduced organic compounds such as lipids and waxes from decomposition. Further, shifting from anaerobic to aerobic conditions leads to a 10-fold increase in volume-specific mineralization rate, illustrating the sensitivity of anaerobically protected carbon to disturbance. The vulnerability of anaerobically protected carbon to future climate or land use change thus constitutes a yet unrecognized soil carbon–climate feedback that should be incorporated into terrestrial ecosystem models.},

Here we incubate Mollisols from ecosystems under C3/C4 plant rotations at moisture levels at and above field capacity over 5 months. Increased moisture and anaerobiosis initially suppress soil C mineralization, consistent with theory. However, after 25 days, elevated moisture stimulates cumulative gaseous C-loss as CO2 and CH4 to {\textgreater}150\% of the control. Stable C isotopes show that mineralization of older C3-derived C released following Fe reduction dominates C losses.

But up to now, research on these so called ‘priming effects’ was almost exclusively conducted with arable soils and with plant residues or glucose as additives. In this study, the effects of the uniformly 14C-labelled substrates fructose, alanine, oxalic acid and catechol on the mineralisation of soil organic carbon (SOC) from different horizons of two forest soils (Haplic Podzol and Dystric Cambisol) and one arable soil (Haplic Phaeozem) under maize and rye cultivation were investigated in incubation experiments for 26 days. Apart from the controls, all samples received substrate additions of 13.3μg substrate-C mg−1 Corg. During the incubation, CO2-evolution was measured hourly and the amount of 14CO2 was determined at various time intervals. In almost all soils, priming effects were induced by one or several of the added substrates. The strongest positive priming effects were induced by fructose and alanine and occurred in the Bs horizon of the Haplic Podzol, where SOC mineralisation was nearly doubled. In the other soil samples, these substrates enhanced SOC mineralisation by +10 to +63\%. Catechol additions generally reduced SOC mineralisation by −12 to −43\% except in the EA horizon of the Haplic Podzol where SOC-borne CO2-evolution increased by +46\%. Oxalic acid also induced negative as well as positive priming effects ranging from −24 to +82\%. The data indicate that priming effects are ubiquitously occurring in surface and subsoil horizons of forest soils as well as in arable soils. Although a broad variety of soils was used within this study, relationships between soil properties and priming effects could not be ascertained. Therefore, a prediction on occurrence and magnitude of priming effects based on relatively easily measurable chemical and physical soil properties was not possible. Nevertheless, the data suggest that positive priming effects are most pronounced in forest soils that contain SOC of low biodegradability, where the added substrates may act as an important energy source for microbial metabolism.},

Glucose and glutamic acid showed a positive priming effect with a CO2 flush from native organic matter. Oxalic and glutamic acids changed the denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiles of soil bacterial communities with the appearance of a few extra-bands in the 0–2 mm soil layer.

The amount of 14CO2 was determined after 4, 6, 12, 19, and 26 days. After 26 days of incubation, each substrate showed priming effects, but not in all examined treatments. Most substrates stimulated the degradation of the model substances (positive priming effects). Negative priming effects only were found in the lignin system with oxalic acid and catechol addition at both concentrations. The strongest positive priming occurred in the peat system with the oxalic acid addition of 80 μg C g—1 where 1.8 \% of the peat were mineralized after 26 days, compared to 0.7 \% in the control. The addition of 400 μg alanine-C g—1 caused the strongest increase in lignin mineralization, amounting to 3.9 \% compared to 2.8 \% in the control. During the incubation the extent of priming changed with time. Most substrates caused the strongest effects during the first 4 to 10 days of incubation. The extent of priming depended on substrate type, substrate concentration, and organic model substance. Possibly this is due to the activation of different microorganisms.},

	abstract = {Priming effects are strong short-term changes in the turnover of soil organic matter caused by comparatively moderate treatments of the soil. In the course of priming effects large amounts of C, N and other nutrients can be released or immobilized in soil in a very short time. These effects have been measured in many field and laboratory experiments; however, only a few of the studies were aimed at an extended investigation of the mechanisms of such phenomena. The aim of this overview is to reveal possible causes and processes leading to priming actions using the references on agricultural ecosystems and model experiments. Multiple mechanisms and sources of released C and N are presented and summarized in Tables for positive and negative real and apparent priming effects induced after the addition of different organic and mineral substances to the soil. Soil microbial biomass plays the key role in the processes leading to the real priming effects. The most important mechanisms for the real priming effects are the acceleration or retardation of soil organic matter turnover due to increased activity or amount of microbial biomass. Isotopic exchange, pool substitution, and different uncontrolled losses of mineralized N from the soil are responsible for the apparent N priming effects. Other multiple mechanisms (predation, competition for nutrients between roots and microorganisms, preferred uptake, inhibition, etc.) in response to addition of different substances are also discussed. These mechanisms can be distinguished from each other by the simultaneous monitoring of C and N release dynamics; its comparison with the course of microbial activity; and by the labelling of different pools with 14C or 13C and 15N. Quantitative methods for describing priming effects and their dynamics using 14C and 15N isotopes, as well as for non-isotopic studies are proposed.},

	abstract = {Until recently, the common view of the terrestrial nitrogen cycle had been driven by two core assumptions—plants use only inorganic N and they compete poorly against soil microbes for N. Thus, plants were thought to use N that microbes “left over,” allowing the N cycle to be divided cleanly into two pieces—the microbial decomposition side and the plant uptake and use side. These were linked by the process of net mineralization. Over the last decade, research has changed these views. N cycling is now seen as being driven by the depolymerization of N-containing polymers by microbial (including mycorrhizal) extracellular enzymes. This releases organic N-containing monomers that may be used by either plants or microbes. However, a complete new conceptual model of the soil N cycle needs to incorporate recent research on plant–microbe competition and microsite processes to explain the dynamics of N across the wide range of N availability found in terrestrial ecosystems. We discuss the evolution of thinking about the soil N cycle, propose a new integrated conceptual model that explains how N cycling changes as ecosystem N availability changes, and discuss methodological issues raised by the changing paradigm of terrestrial N cycling.},

	abstract = {Transformation of organic residues into plant-available nutrients occurs through decomposition and mineralization and is mediated by saprophytic microorganisms and fauna. Of particular interest is the recycling of the essential plant elements—N, P, and S—contained in organic residues. If organic residues can supply sufficient nutrients during crop growth, a reduction in fertilizer use is possible. The challenge is synchronizing nutrient release from organic residues with crop nutrient demands throughout the growing season. This paper presents a conceptual model describing the pattern of nutrient release from organic residues in relation to crop nutrient uptake. Next, it explores experimental approaches to measure the physical, chemical, and biological barriers to decomposition and nutrient mineralization. Methods are proposed to determine the rates of decomposition and nutrient release from organic residues. Practically, this information can be used by agricultural producers to determine if plant-available nutrient supply is sufficient to meet crop demands at key growth stages or whether additional fertilizer is needed. Finally, agronomic practices that control the rate of soil biota-mediated decomposition and mineralization, as well as those that facilitate uptake of plant-available nutrients, are identified. Increasing reliance on soil biological activity could benefit crop nutrition and health in sustainable agroecosystems.},

As a result, the molecular characteristics of soil C are now known for a range of ecosystems, soil types, and management intensities. Placing this knowledge into a broader ecological and management context is difficult, however, and remains one of the fundamental challenges of soil organic matter research. Here we present a conceptual model of molecular soil C dynamics to stimulate inter-disciplinary research into the ecological implications of molecular C turnover and its management- and process-level controls. Our model describes three properties of soil C dynamics: 1) soil size fractions have unique molecular patterns that reflect varying degrees of biological and physical control over decomposition; 2) there is a common decomposition sequence independent of plant inputs or other ecosystem properties; and 3) molecular decomposition sequences, although consistent, are not uniform and can be altered by processes that accelerate or slow the microbial transformation of specific molecules. The consequences of this model include several key points. First, lignin presents a constraint to decomposition of plant litter and particulate C ({\textgreater}53 microm) but exerts little influence on more stable mineral-associated soil fractions {\textless}53 microm. Second, carbon stabilized onto mineral fractions has a distinct composition related more to microbially processed organic matter than to plant-related compounds. Third, disturbances, such as N fertilization and tillage, which alter decomposition rates, can have "downstream effects"; that is, a disturbance that directly alters the molecular dynamics of particulate C may have a series of indirect effects on C stabilization in silt and clay fractions.},

This review aims to assess the role of low molecular weight (LMW) DOM compounds in the C dynamics of temperate and boreal forest soils focussing in particular on organic acids, amino acids and sugars. The current knowledge of concentrations, mineralization kinetics and production rates and sources in soil are summarised. We conclude that although these LMW compounds are typically maintained at very low concentrations in the soil solution ({\textless}50μM), the flux through this pool is extremely rapid (mean residence time 1–10h) due to continued microbial removal. Due to this rapid flux through the soil solution pool and mineralization to CO2, we calculate that the turnover of these LMW compounds may contribute substantially to the total CO2 efflux from the soil. Moreover, the production rates of these soluble transitory compounds could exceed HMW DOM production. The possible impact of climate change on the behaviour of LMW compounds in soil is also discussed.},

The concern is that rising temperatures may be causing some of the massive reserves of carbon stored in the soil to be released into the atmosphere as the greenhouse gas CO2, resulting in a further increase in temperature and yet more CO2 release. So far what evidence there is for this feedback mechanism has come from small-scale laboratory and field experiments and mathematical modelling. Now a team from the UK National Soil Resources Institute and Rothamsted Research presents data from a long-term national-scale soil monitoring scheme that reveal extensive carbon losses during the past 25 years: land use has little effect on the rate of carbon loss suggesting a possible link to climate change.},

	abstract = {One-fourth of the global soil organic carbon (SOC) is stored in the boreal region, where climate change is predicted to be faster than the global average. Planetary warming is accelerated if climate change promotes SOC release into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. However, the soil carbon-climate feedbacks have been poorly confirmed by SOC measurements despite their importance on global climate. In this study, we used data collected as part of the Finnish arable soil monitoring program to study the influence of climate change, management practices, and historical land use on changes in SOC content using a Bayesian approach. Topsoil samples (n = 385) collected nationwide in 2009 and 2018 showed that SOC content has decreased at the rate of 0.35\% year−1 on average. Based on the Bayesian modeling of our data, we can say with a certainty of 79\%–91\% that increase in summertime (May–Sep) temperature has resulted in SOC loss while increased precipitation has resulted in SOC loss with a certainty of 90\%–97\%. The exact percentages depend on the climate dataset used. Historical land use was found to influence the SOC content for decades after conversion to cropland. Former organic soils with a high SOC-to-fine-fraction ratio were prone to high SOC loss. In fields with long cultivation history ({\textgreater}100 years), however, the SOC-to-fine-fraction ratio had stabilized to approximately 0.03–0.04 and the changes in SOC content leveled off. Our results showed that, although arable SOC sequestration can be promoted by diversifying crop rotations and by cultivating perennial grasses, it is unlikely that improved management practices are sufficient to counterbalance the climate change-induced SOC losses in boreal conditions. This underlines the importance of the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to avoid the acceleration of planetary warming.},

Regional model-based SOC projections are needed to evaluate these potential risks. In this study, we simulated the future SOC development in cropland and grassland soils of Bavaria in the 21st century. Soils from 51 study sites representing the most important soil classes of Central Europe were fractionated and derived SOC pools were used to initialize the RothC soil carbon model. For each site, long-term C inputs were determined using the C allocation method. Model runs were performed for three different C input scenarios as a realistic range of projected yield development. Our modelling approach revealed substantial SOC decreases of 11–16\% under an expected mean temperature increase of 3.3 °C assuming unchanged C inputs. For the scenario of 20\% reduced C inputs, agricultural SOC stocks are projected to decline by 19–24\%. Remarkably, even the optimistic scenario of 20\% increased C inputs led to SOC decreases of 3–8\%. Projected SOC changes largely differed among investigated soil classes. Our results indicated that C inputs have to increase by 29\% to maintain present SOC stocks in agricultural soils.},

The global soil-to-atmosphere (or total soil respiration, RS) carbon dioxide (CO2) flux is increasing3,4, but the degree to which climate change will stimulate carbon losses from soils as a result of heterotrophic respiration (RH) remains highly uncertain5–8. Here we use an updated global soil respiration database9 to show that the observed soil surface RH:RS ratio increased significantly, from 0.54 to 0.63, between 1990 and 2014 (P = 0.009). Three additional lines of evidence provide support for this finding. By analysing two separate global gross primary production datasets10,11, we find that the ratios of both RH and RS to gross primary production have increased over time. Similarly, significant increases in RH are observed against the longest available solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence global dataset, as well as gross primary production computed by an ensemble of global land models. We also show that the ratio of night-time net ecosystem exchange to gross primary production is rising across the FLUXNET201512 dataset. All trends are robust to sampling variability in ecosystem type, disturbance, methodology, CO2 fertilization effects and mean climate. Taken together, our findings provide observational evidence that global RH is rising, probably in response to environmental changes, consistent with meta-analyses13–16 and long-term experiments17. This suggests that climate-driven losses of soil carbon are currently occurring across many ecosystems, with a detectable and sustained trend emerging at the global scale.},

Two major lines of evidence support net global SOC losses with warming via increases in soil microbial metabolic activity: the increase in soil respiration with temperature and the accumulation of SOC in low mean annual temperature regions. Warming-induced SOC losses are likely to be of a magnitude relevant for emission negotiations and necessitate more aggressive emission reduction targets to limit climate change to 1.5 °C by 2100. We suggest that microbial community–temperature interactions, and how they are influenced by substrate availability, are promising research areas to improve the accuracy and precision of the magnitude estimates of projected SOC losses.},

	abstract = {A large source of uncertainty in present understanding of the global carbon cycle is the distribution and dynamics of the soil organic carbon reservoir. Most of the organic carbon in soils is degraded to inorganic forms slowly, on timescales from centuries to millennia1. Soil minerals are known to play a stabilizing role, but how spatial and temporal variation in soil mineralogy controls the quantity and turnover of long-residence-time organic carbon is not well known2. Here we use radiocarbon analyses to explore interactions between soil mineralogy and soil organic carbon along two natural gradients—of soil-age and of climate—in volcanic soil environments. During the first ∼150,000 years of soil development, the volcanic parent material weathered to metastable, non-crystalline minerals. Thereafter, the amount of non-crystalline minerals declined, and more stable crystalline minerals accumulated. Soil organic carbon content followed a similar trend, accumulating to a maximum after 150,000 years, and then decreasing by 50\% over the next four million years. A positive relationship between non-crystalline minerals and organic carbon was also observed in soils through the climate gradient, indicating that the accumulation and subsequent loss of organic matter were largely driven by changes in the millennial scale cycling of mineral-stabilized carbon, rather than by changes in the amount of fast-cycling organic matter or in net primary productivity. Soil mineralogy is therefore important in determining the quantity of organic carbon stored in soil, its turnover time, and atmosphere–ecosystem carbon fluxes during long-term soil development; this conclusion should be generalizable at least to other humid environments.},

In soil profiles, strikingly similar patterns of decreasing C:N and 15N isotopic enrichment with increasing depth are well documented. The parallel trend in organic matter composition with soil depth and during plant residue decay has been used as evidence to suggest that organic products accumulate or develop in the subsoil due to increasing intensity of microbially-driven processing, although no studies to date have verified this. Here, by applying sequential density fractionation, specific surface area, oxalate extractable Fe and Al, C:N and δ15N measures with depth to soils with relatively uniform soil mineralogy (Oxisols), climates and vegetation we show that changes in organo-mineral associations drive subsoil C:N and δ15N and C:N depth patterns more than in situ organic matter decay. Our results provide the first direct evidence that soil depth trends could be driven by mineral association instead of in situ processing.},

We collated observations from 453 paired or chronosequential sites where forests have been converted to agricultural land and then assessed the effects of forest type, cultivation stage, climate factors and soil properties on the change in the SOC stock and the SOC turnover rate constant (k). The percent decrease in SOC stocks and the turnover rate constants both varied significantly according to forest type and cultivation stage. The largest decrease in SOC stocks was observed in temperate regions (52\% decrease), followed by tropical regions (41\% decrease) and boreal regions (31\% decrease). Climate and soil factors affected the decrease in SOC stocks. The SOC turnover rate constant after the conversion of forests to agricultural land increased with the mean annual precipitation and temperature. To our knowledge, this is the first time that original forest type was considered when evaluating changes in SOC after being converted to agricultural land. The differences between forest types should be considered when calculating global changes in SOC stocks.},

	abstract = {Plant roots contribute substantially to the formation of stable soil organic matter (SOM), and there is evidence that species differ in their contribution to SOM stabilization. However, it remains unclear what specific root traits contribute to the three SOM stabilization mechanisms: recalcitrance against decomposition, occlusion in soil aggregates and interaction with soil minerals and metals. This is likely because research is highly fragmented and hampered by disciplinary barriers. By reviewing both plant functional ecology and soil science literature, we identified 18 different traits: architectural, morphological, physiological, symbiotic and chemical root characteristics, influencing the three SOM stabilization mechanisms. We found that traits increasing root recalcitrance promote short term stabilization by slowing decomposition, but that traits reducing recalcitrance contribute to long term stabilization by reaction of microbial products with mineral surfaces. Root length density, mycorrhizal association and rhizodeposition contribute to microaggregation. These and other traits, such as hemicellulose, soluble compounds, and high root branching index, favor macroaggregation. For stabilization by minerals and metals, those root traits promoting higher microbial activity: root nitrogen, hemicellulose and soluble compound concentrations are fundamental, while polyphenols, and litter Al and Mn also contribute to complexification and stabilization. Root depth distribution is the most important trait to control root C storage and stabilization in the subsoil; once roots have reached deeper soil layers, other traits, such as rhizodeposition and root chemistry, influence interaction with minerals and metals. Both mycorrhizal presence and root suberin promote SOC stabilization by means of all three mechanisms, indicating that these are important targets for continued work. Surprisingly, morphological traits commonly measured, namely specific root length and root diameter, poorly relate to stabilization mechanisms. Alternative traits such as chemical composition of the different root orders, root apex characteristics, quantity and quality of rhizodeposits as well as mycorrhizal fungal traits, should be further investigated. For future research, this review highlights the need to evaluate root decomposition and root-C stabilization concomitantly over the long-term, considering simultaneously root litter quality, estimated by root traits, the microbial products and properties of the soil matrix. The information accrued in this review can be used to evaluate the potential of plant species and cultivars to promote SOM stabilization, based on their root traits.},

However, the mechanisms underlying the positive plant diversity effects on soil carbon storage are poorly understood. We explored this relationship using long-term data from a grassland biodiversity experiment (The Jena Experiment) and radiocarbon (14C) modelling. Here we show that higher plant diversity increases rhizosphere carbon inputs into the microbial community resulting in both increased microbial activity and carbon storage. Increases in soil carbon were related to the enhanced accumulation of recently fixed carbon in high-diversity plots, while plant diversity had less pronounced effects on the decomposition rate of existing carbon. The present study shows that elevated carbon storage at high plant diversity is a direct function of the soil microbial community, indicating that the increase in carbon storage is mainly limited by the integration of new carbon into soil and less by the decomposition of existing soil carbon.},

	abstract = {Soils are important for ecosystem functioning and service provisioning. Soil communities and their functions, in turn, are strongly promoted by plant diversity, and such positive effects strengthen with time. However, plant diversity effects on soil organic matter have mostly been investigated in the topsoil, and there are only very few long-term studies. Thus, it remains unclear if plant diversity effects strengthen with time and to which depth these effects extend. Here, we repeatedly sampled soil to 1 m depth in a long-term grassland biodiversity experiment. We investigated how plant diversity impacted soil organic carbon and nitrogen concentrations and stocks and their stable isotopes 13C and 15N, as well as how these effects changed after 5, 10, and 14 years. We found that higher plant diversity increased carbon and nitrogen storage in the topsoil since the establishment of the experiment. Stable isotopes revealed that these increases were associated with new plant-derived inputs, resulting in less processed and less decomposed soil organic matter. In subsoils, mainly the presence of specific plant functional groups drove organic matter dynamics. For example, the presence of deep-rooting tall herbs decreased carbon concentrations, most probably through stimulating soil organic matter decomposition. Moreover, plant diversity effects on soil organic matter became stronger in topsoil over time and reached subsoil layers, while the effects of specific plant functional groups in subsoil progressively diminished over time. Our results indicate that after changing the soil system the pathways of organic matter transfer to the subsoil need time to establish. In our grassland system, organic matter storage in subsoils was driven by the redistribution of already stored soil organic matter from the topsoil to deeper soil layers, for example, via bioturbation or dissolved organic matter. Therefore, managing plant diversity may, thus, have significant implications for subsoil carbon storage and other critical ecosystem services.},

In this study, we performed a meta-analysis by collecting data from 95 biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) studies across 60 sites to explore the effects of plant diversity on different C pools, including aboveground and belowground plant biomass, soil microbial biomass C and soil C content across different ecosystem types. The results showed that ecosystem C storage was significantly enhanced by plant diversity, with stronger effects on aboveground biomass than on soil C content. Moreover, the response magnitudes of ecosystem C storage increased with the level of species richness and experimental duration across all ecosystems. The effects of plant diversity were more pronounced in grasslands than in forests. Furthermore, the effects of plant diversity on belowground plant biomass increased with aridity index in grasslands and forests, suggesting that climate change might modulate biodiversity effects, which are stronger under wetter conditions but weaker under more arid conditions. Taken together, these results provide novel insights into the important role of plant diversity in ecosystem C storage across critical C pools, ecosystem types and environmental contexts.},

The higher soil carbon storage rates of the second period (years 13–22) are associated with the greater aboveground production and root biomass of this period, and with the presence of multiple species, especially C4 grasses and legumes. Our results suggest that restoration of high plant diversity may greatly increase carbon capture and storage rates on degraded and abandoned agricultural lands.},

	abstract = {Soil organic matter (OM) can be stabilized against decomposition by association with minerals, by its inherent recalcitrance and by occlusion in aggregates. However, the relative contribution of these factors to OM stabilization is yet unknown. We analyzed pool size and isotopic composition (14C, 13C) of mineral-protected and recalcitrant OM in 12 subsurface horizons from 10 acidic forest soils. The results were related to properties of the mineral phase and to OM composition as revealed by CPMAS 13C-NMR and CuO oxidation. Stable OM was defined as that material which survived treatment of soils with 6 wt\% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl). Mineral-protected OM was extracted by subsequent dissolution of minerals by 10\% hydrofluoric acid (HF). Organic matter resistant against NaOCl and insoluble in HF was considered as recalcitrant OM. Hypochlorite removed primarily 14C-modern OM. Of the stable organic carbon (OC), amounting to 2.4–20.6 g kg−1 soil, mineral dissolution released on average 73\%. Poorly crystalline Fe and Al phases (Feo, Alo) and crystalline Fe oxides (Fed−o) explained 86\% of the variability of mineral-protected OC. Atomic Cp/(Fe+Al)p ratios of 1.3–6.5 suggest that a portion of stable OM was associated with polymeric Fe and Al species. Recalcitrant OC (0.4–6.5 g kg−1 soil) contributed on average 27\% to stable OC and the amount was not correlated with any mineralogical property. Recalcitrant OC had lower Δ14C and δ13C values than mineral-protected OC and was mainly composed of aliphatic (56\%) and O-alkyl (13\%) C moieties. Lignin phenols were only present in small amounts in either mineral-protected or recalcitrant OM (mean 4.3 and 0.2 g kg−1 OC). The results confirm that stabilization of OM by interaction with poorly crystalline minerals and polymeric metal species is the most important mechanism for preservation of OM in these acid subsoil horizons.},

	abstract = {Extracellular enzymes degrade complex organic compounds and contribute to carbon turnover in soils. We used physical fractionation procedures to investigate whether soil carbon is spatially isolated from degradative enzymes across a prairie restoration chronosequence in Illinois, USA. We found that carbon-degrading enzymes were abundant in all soil fractions, including macroaggregates, microaggregates, and the clay-sized fraction. The activities of two cellulose-degrading enzymes and a chitin-degrading enzyme were 2–10 times greater in particulate organic matter (POM) fractions than in bulk soil, consistent with the rapid turnover of POM fractions. Polyphenol oxidase activity in the clay-sized fraction was 3 times that in the bulk soil, despite a higher mean residence time for carbon in the clay-sized fraction. For most enzymes, differences in activity among fractions and across the restoration chronosequence diminished when adjusted for differences in carbon concentrations. However, glycine aminopeptidase activity per unit carbon increased four-fold across the chronosequence in the clay fraction, while polyphenol oxidase activity declined by 40\%. These results suggest that enzyme production and carbon turnover occur rapidly in POM fractions, but slowly in mineral-dominated fractions where enzymes and their carbon substrates are immobilized on mineral surfaces. Soil carbon accumulation in mineral fractions and across the prairie restoration chronosequence probably reflects increasing physical isolation of enzymes and substrates on the molecular to micron scale, rather than exclusion of enzymes from entire soil fractions. Based on these mechanisms, land managers could increase soil C stocks by reducing the physical disruption of soil structure associated with cultivation.},

	abstract = {Soil microbes produce extracellular enzymes that mineralize organic matter and release carbon and nutrients in forms that can be assimilated. Economic theories of microbial metabolism predict that enzyme production should increase when simple nutrients are scarce and complex nutrients are abundant; however, resource limitation could also constrain enzyme production. We tested these hypotheses by monitoring enzyme activities and nutrient pools in soil incubations with added simple and complex nutrient compounds. Over 28 days of incubation, we found that an enzyme's activity increased when its target nutrient was present in complex but not simple form, and carbon and nitrogen were available. β-Glucosidase and acid phosphatase activities also increased in treatments where only carbon and nitrogen were added. Glycine aminopeptidase and acid phosphatase activities declined in response to ammonium and phosphate additions, respectively. In some cases, mineralization responses paralleled changes in enzyme activity—for example, β-glucosidase activity increased and respiration was 5-fold greater in soil incubations with added cellulose, ammonium, and phosphate. However, a doubling of acid phosphatase activity in response to collagen addition was not associated with any changes in phosphorus mineralization. Our results indicate that microbes produce enzymes according to ‘economic rules’, but a substantial pool of mineral stabilized or constitutive enzymes mediates this response. Enzyme allocation patterns reflect microbial nutrient demands and may allow microbes to acquire limiting nutrients from complex substrates available in the soil.},

	abstract = {This review focuses on some important and challenging aspects of soil extracellular enzyme research. We report on recent discoveries, identify key research needs and highlight the many opportunities offered by interactions with other microbial enzymologists. The biggest challenges are to understand how the chemical, physical and biological properties of soil affect enzyme production, diffusion, substrate turnover and the proportion of the product that is made available to the producer cells. Thus, the factors that regulate the synthesis and secretion of extracellular enzymes and their distribution after they are externalized are important topics, not only for soil enzymologists, but also in the broader context of microbial ecology. In addition, there are many uncertainties about the ways in which microbes and their extracellular enzymes overcome the generally destructive, inhibitory and competitive properties of the soil matrix, and the various strategies they adopt for effective substrate detection and utilization. The complexity of extracellular enzyme activities in depolymerising macromolecular organics is exemplified by lignocellulose degradation and how the many enzymes involved respond to structural diversity and changing nutrient availabilities. The impacts of climate change on microbes and their extracellular enzymes, although of profound importance, are not well understood but we suggest how they may be predicted, assessed and managed. We describe recent advances that allow for the manipulation of extracellular enzyme activities to facilitate bioremediation, carbon sequestration and plant growth promotion. We also contribute to the ongoing debate as to how to assay enzyme activities in soil and what the measurements tell us, in the context of both traditional methods and the newer techniques that are being developed and adopted. Finally, we offer our collective vision of the future of extracellular enzyme research: one that will depend on imaginative thinking as well as technological advances, and be built upon synergies between diverse disciplines.},

Enzyme kinetics (Vmax and Km) were estimated in three particle-size fractions and the unfractionated soil. The results showed that not all particle-size fractions were equally enzymatically active and that the distribution of enzymes between fractions depended on the enzyme. Carbohydrases predominated in the coarser fractions while phosphatase and leucine-aminopeptidase were predominant in the clay-size fraction. The Michaelis constant (Km) varied among fractions, indicating that the association of the same enzyme with different particle-size fractions affected its substrate affinity. The same values of Km were found in the same fractions from the soil under two contrasting fertilizer management regimes, indicating that the Michaelis constant was unaffected by soil changes caused by N fertilizer management.},

	abstract = {Extracellular enzymes mediate the degradation, transformation and mineralization of soil organic matter. The activity of cellulases, phosphatases and other hydrolases has received extensive study and in many cases stoichiometric relationships and responses to disturbances are well established. In contrast, phenol oxidase and peroxidase activities, which are often uncorrelated with hydrolase activities, have been measured in only a small subset of soil enzyme studies. These enzymes are expressed for a variety of purposes including ontogeny, defense and the acquisition of carbon and nitrogen. Through excretion or lysis, these enzymes enter the environment where their aggegrate activity mediates key ecosystem functions of lignin degradation, humification, carbon mineralization and dissolved organic carbon export. Phenol oxidases and peroxidases are less stable in the environment than extracellular hydrolases, especially when associated with organic particles. Activities are also affected, positively and negatively, by interaction with mineral surfaces. High spatiotemporal variation obscures their relationships with environmental variables and ecological process. Across ecosystems, phenol oxidase and peroxidase activities generally increase with soil pH, a finding not predicted from the pH optima of purified enzymes. Activities associated with plant litter and particulate organic matter often correlate with decomposition rates and potential activities generally increase with the lignin and secondary compound content of the material. At the ecosystem scale, nitrogen amendment alters the expression of phenol oxidase and peroxidase enzymes more broadly than culture studies imply and these responses correlate with positive and negative changes in litter decomposition rates and soil organic matter content. At the global scale, N amendment of basidiomycete-dominated soils of temperate and boreal forest ecoystems often leads to losses of oxidative enzyme activity, while activities in grassland soils dominated by glomeromycota and ascomycetes show little net response. Land use that leads to loss of soil organic matter tends to increase oxidative activities. Across ecosystems, soil organic matter content is not correlated with mean potential phenol oxidase and peroxidase activities. A multiple regression model that includes soil pH, mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation and potential phenol oxidase activity accounts for 37\% of the variation in soil organic matter (SOM) content across ecosystems (n = 63); a similar model for peroxidase activity describes 32\% of SOM variance (n = 43). Analysis of residual variation suggest that suites of interacting factors create both positive and negative feedbacks on soil organic matter storage. Soils with high oxygen availability, pH and mineral activity tend to be substrate limited: high in situ oxidative activities limit soil organic matter accumulation. Soils with opposing characteristics are activity limited: low in situ oxidative activities promote soil organic matter storage.},

	abstract = {Recent studies of nitrogen (N) cycling in arctic tundra have indicated that inorganic N supplied to plants by mineralization is not sufficient to meet the annual requirement of N by many tundra species. Whereas N mineralization is slow in tundra soils and concentrations of inorganic N are low, these soils have large stocks of both structural and soluble organic N. In light of these observations, kinetics of absorption of three amino acids (glycine, aspartic acid, and glutamic acid) were measured in dominant vascular plant species of the four major ecosystems types in arctic Alaska and compared with concentrations of free amino acids in soils. Absorption rates were measured on roots using 14C—labeled substrates. Concentrations of free amino acids in soil were measured on water—extracted samples by high pressure liquid chromatography. All species had higher capacity (Vmax) for ammonium uptake (measured using methylamine as an ammonium analogue) than for any amino acid. However, at concentrations observed in the field, uptake rates estimated for amino acids were similar to (glycine) or less than (aspartic and glutamic acids) that for ammonium. On the basis of these comparisons, uptake rates of the three amino acids together may account for between 10 and 82\% of the total N uptake in the field, depending on species and community. Deciduous shrubs had higher uptake rates than the more slowly growing evergreen shrubs, suggesting that new growth created a sink that strongly influenced capacity for amino acid uptake. In general, ectomycorrhizal species had higher amino acid uptake than did non—mycorrhizal species. In species that were sampled from more than one community, amino acid uptake rates were highest in the community where a given amino acid was most abundant in the soil. The results indicate that, in arctic tundra, plants short—circuit the mineralization step of decomposition by directly absorbing amino acids. This implies that in the organic soils of these tundra systems (1) inorganic nitrogen is an inadequate measure of plant—available soil nitrogen, (2) mineralization rates underestimate nitrogen supply rates to plants, (3) the large differences among species in capacities to absorb different forms of N provide ample basis for niche differentiation of what was previously considered a single resource, and (4) by short—circuiting N mineralization, plants accelerate N turnover and effectively exert greater control over N cycling than has been previously recognized.},

Absorption experiments with aspartate and glutamate, demonstrate that higher-molecular weight amino acids also can be absorbed at substantial rates compared to inorganic nitrogen.

The presumed cause of this limitation is slow mineralization of soil organic nitrogen1,2. Here we demonstrate, to our knowledge for the first time, the uptake of organic nitrogen in the field by the trees Pinus sylvestris and Picea abies, the dwarf shrub Vaccinium myrtillus and the grass Deschampsia flexuosa. These results show that these plants, irrespective of their different types of root–fungal associations (mycorrhiza), bypass nitrogen mineralization. A trace of the amino acid glycine, labelled with the stable isotopes 13C and 15N, was injected into the organic (mor) layer of an old successional boreal coniferous forest. Ratios of 13C:15N in the roots showed that at least 91, 64 and 42\% of the nitrogen from the absorbed glycine was taken up in intact glycine by the dwarf shrub, the grass and the trees, respectively. Rates of glycine uptake were similar to those of 15N-ammonium. Our data indicate that organic nitrogen is important for these different plants, even when they are competing with each other and with non-symbiotic microorganisms. This has major implications for our understanding of the effects of nitrogen deposition, global warming and intensified forestry.},

The pools are filled intermittently during the summer rains, and the plants may pass through up 20 rehydration/dehydration cycles during a single wet season. Rehydrated plants also have to cope with substantial diurnal fluctuations in the pH and extreme nutrient deficiency. Ammonium concentrations are normally around 30 μM. Additional nitrogen sources are amino acids. Total free amino acids are up to 15 μM with glycine and serine as the predominant amino acids. Experiments on uptake of radiolabelled amino acids into roots of C. intrepidus showed high␣affinity (KM= 16 μM) and low-affinity (KM= 159 μM) uptake systems. The KM of the high-affinity system is well in accordance with the free amino acid concentration found in the water of the pools. We conclude that amino acids, predominantly glycine and serine, can be utilised by C. intrepidus in its natural habitat. Since glycine uptake showed a strong reduction at pH 10, nitrogen uptake from glycine or serine should occur mainly in the morning when the pH of the pool water is slightly acid. Further experiments with 15N-labelled ammonium in combination with non-labelled glycine demonstrated high 15N values in plant tissues. Under experimental conditions C. intrepidus preferred ammonium as a nitrogen source. The implication of amino acids for nitrogen nutrition of C. intrepidus may depend on the relation of inorganic and organic nitrogen available in the pool water and the preferential utilisation of one or the other nitrogen source may change during the day corresponding with pH changes in the water.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Current knowledge of the mechanisms driving soil organic matter (SOM) turnover and responses to warming is mainly limited to surface soils, although over 50\% of global soil carbon is contained in subsoils. Deep soils have different physicochemical properties, nutrient inputs, and microbiomes, which may harbor distinct functional traits and lead to different SOM dynamics and temperature responses. We hypothesized that kinetic and thermal properties of soil exoenzymes, which mediate SOM depolymerization, vary with soil depth, reflecting microbial adaptation to distinct substrate and temperature regimes. We determined the Michaelis-Menten (MM) kinetics of three ubiquitous enzymes involved in carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) acquisition at six soil depths down to 90 cm at a temperate forest, and their temperature sensitivity based on Arrhenius/{\textless}italic{\textgreater}Q{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{10}}$ and Macromolecular Rate Theory (MMRT) models over six temperatures between 4–50°C. Maximal enzyme velocity ({\textless}italic{\textgreater}V{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{max}}$) decreased strongly with depth for all enzymes, both on a dry soil mass and a microbial biomass C basis, whereas their affinities increased, indicating adaptation to lower substrate availability. Surprisingly, microbial biomass-specific catalytic efficiencies also decreased with depth, except for the P-acquiring enzyme, indicating distinct nutrient demands at depth relative to microbial abundance. These results suggested that deep soil microbiomes encode enzymes with intrinsically lower turnover and/or produce less enzymes per cell, reflecting distinct life strategies. The relative kinetics between different enzymes also varied with depth, suggesting an increase in relative P demand with depth, or that phosphatases may be involved in C acquisition. {\textless}italic{\textgreater}V{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{max}}$ and catalytic efficiency increased consistently with temperature for all enzymes, leading to overall higher SOM-decomposition potential, but enzyme temperature sensitivity was similar at all depths and between enzymes, based on both Arrhenius/{\textless}italic{\textgreater}Q{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{10}}$ and MMRT models. In a few cases, however, temperature affected differently the kinetic properties of distinct enzymes at discrete depths, suggesting that it may alter the relative depolymerization of different compounds. We show that soil exoenzyme kinetics may reflect intrinsic traits of microbiomes adapted to distinct soil depths, although their temperature sensitivity is remarkably uniform. These results improve our understanding of critical mechanisms underlying SOM dynamics and responses to changing temperatures through the soil profile.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

It is well established that plant roots take up nitrogen compounds of low molecular mass, including ammonium, nitrate, and amino acids. However, in the soil of natural ecosystems, nitrogen occurs predominantly as proteins. This complex organic form of nitrogen is considered to be not directly available to plants. We examined the long-held view that plants depend on specialized symbioses with fungi (mycorrhizas) to access soil protein and studied the woody heathland plant Hakea actites and the herbaceous model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, which do not form mycorrhizas. We show that both species can use protein as a nitrogen source for growth without assistance from other organisms. We identified two mechanisms by which roots access protein. Roots exude proteolytic enzymes that digest protein at the root surface and possibly in the apoplast of the root cortex. Intact protein also was taken up into root cells most likely via endocytosis. These findings change our view of the spectrum of nitrogen sources that plants can access and challenge the current paradigm that plants rely on microbes and soil fauna for the breakdown of organic matter.},

Many have observed that biological communities could feed back to, and not simply result from, soil properties. But which group of organisms, plants or microorganisms, drive those feedback systems? Recent research asserts that soil microorganisms preclude plant species feedback to soil nitrogen (N) transformations due to strong microbial control of soil N cycling. It has been well documented that litter properties influence soil N cycling. In this review, we stress that under many circumstances plant species exert a major influence over soil N cycling rates via unique N attainment strategies, thus influencing soil N availability and their own fitness. We offer two testable mechanisms by which plants impart active control on the N cycle and thereby allow for plant–litter–soil–plant feedback. Finally, we describe the characteristics of plants and ecosystems that are most likely to exhibit feedback.},

While several studies have examined site-specific feedbacks between litter chemistry and nitrogen (N) availability, little is known about the interaction between climate, litter chemistry, and N availability across different ecosystems. We assembled data from several studies spanning a wide range of vegetation, soils, and climatic regimes to examine the relationship between aboveground litter chemistry and annual net N mineralization. Net N mineralization declined strongly and non-linearly as the litter lignin:N ratio increased in forest ecosystems (r2 = 0.74, P {\textless} 0.01). Net N mineralization decreased linearly as litter lignin concentration increased, but the relationship was significant (r2 = 0.63, P {\textless} 0.01) only for tree species. Litterfall quantity, N concentration, and N content correlated poorly with net N mineralization across this range of sites (r2 {\textless} 0.03, P = 0.17–0.26). The relationship between the litter lignin:N ratio and net N mineralization from forest floor and mineral soil was similar. The litter lignin:N ratio explained more of the variation in net N mineralization than climatic factors over a wide range of forest age classes, suggesting that litter quality (lignin:N ratio) may exert more than a proximal control over net N mineralization by influencing soil organic matter quality throughout the soil profile independent of climate.},

	abstract = {Plants establish beneficial associations with nitrogen-fixing bacteria and with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) to facilitate the acquisition of nutrients that are limiting to plant growth. These symbiotic associations must be newly established in each plant, and this involves the recognition of diffusible lipochitooligosaccharide (LCO) signals called nodulation factors (Nod factors) and mycorrhizal factors (Myc factors), produced by rhizobia and AMF, respectively.Receptors containing oligosaccharide-binding LysM domains are involved in the recognition of LCOs from microbial symbionts. Two such receptors, Nod factor receptor 1 (NFR1) and NFR5, have been shown to bind Nod factors directly.Recognition of a range of microbial oligosaccharides involves LysM-containing receptor complexes. These receptors can be involved in the promotion of symbiont infection or the restriction of pathogen colonization.A common symbiosis signalling pathway is involved in the promotion of rhizobial and mycorrhizal associations. This signalling pathway uses oscillations in calcium as a secondary messenger. Despite the commonality in signalling in these symbiosis pathways, specificity must be maintained to ensure appropriate responses to each symbiont.The production of symbiont-induced calcium oscillations involves a cation channel (or channels) that is most probably associated with potassium flow, a SERCA-type calcium pump and an as-yet-undefined calcium channel. Modelling suggests that these three components are sufficient for self-sustaining calcium oscillations.Recognition of calcium oscillations involves calcium- and calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine protein kinase (CCaMK), which associates with and phosphorylates a transcriptional regulator. Autoactivation of this calcium-signalling complex is sufficient to promote symbiotic responses.Transcription factor complexes involving a variety of GRAS domain-containing proteins are involved in regulating symbiotic gene expression. The specificity of symbiosis signalling seems to be defined by differential complexes of GRAS domain proteins, and these different complexes have specific roles in the regulation of plant gene expression associated with either rhizobia or AMF.},

	abstract = {Interactions between plants and microbes in soil, the final frontier of ecology, determine the availability of nutrients to plants and thereby primary production of terrestrial ecosystems. Nutrient cycling in soils is considered a battle between autotrophs and heterotrophs in which the latter usually outcompete the former, although recent studies have questioned the unconditional reign of microbes on nutrient cycles and the plants' dependence on microbes for breakdown of organic matter. Here we present evidence indicative of a more active role of plants in nutrient cycling than currently considered. Using fluorescent-labeled non-pathogenic and non-symbiotic strains of a bacterium and a fungus (Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, respectively), we demonstrate that microbes enter root cells and are subsequently digested to release nitrogen that is used in shoots. Extensive modifications of root cell walls, as substantiated by cell wall outgrowth and induction of genes encoding cell wall synthesizing, loosening and degrading enzymes, may facilitate the uptake of microbes into root cells. Our study provides further evidence that the autotrophy of plants has a heterotrophic constituent which could explain the presence of root-inhabiting microbes of unknown ecological function. Our discovery has implications for soil ecology and applications including future sustainable agriculture with efficient nutrient cycles.},

	abstract = {Phosphorus (P) is critical to modern biochemical functions and can control ecosystem growth. It was presumably important as a reagent in prebiotic chemistry. However, on the early Earth, P sources may have consisted primarily of poorly soluble calcium phosphates, which may have rendered phosphate as a minimally available nutrient or reagent if these minerals were the sole source. Here, we review aqueous P availability on the early Earth ({\textgreater}2.5 Gyr ago), considering both mineral sources and geochemical sinks relevant to its solvation, and activation by abiotic and biological pathways. Phosphorus on Earth’s early surface would have been present as a mixture of phosphate minerals, as a minor element in silicate minerals, and in reactive, reduced phases from accreted dust, meteorites and asteroids. These P sources would have weathered and plausibly furnished the prebiotic Earth with abundant and potentially reactive P. After the origin of a biosphere, life evolved to draw on not just reactive available P sources, but also insoluble and unreactive sources. The rise of an ecosystem dependent on this element at some point forged a P-limited biosphere, with evolutionary stress forcing the efficient extraction and recycling of P from both abiotic and biotic sources and sinks.},

Their amount and relative importance varies greatly from place to place. 5 The wide variation in P inputs between sites results in inputs being greater than losses at some sites but less than losses at others.

	abstract = {Leaching, biomass removal, and partitioning of phosphorus (P) into reservoirs not available to plants can limit the long-term productivity of terrestrial ecosystems. We evaluate the importance of atmospheric P inputs to the world's soils by estimating the total soil P turnover time with respect to dustborne P additions. Estimated turnover times range from ∼104 to ∼107 years. Our estimates provide a unique perspective on the importance and patterns of aeolian deposition to terrestrial landscapes. Dust source regions are areas of intense soil P cycling on large scales, but are too water-limited for this rapid cycling to have a major influence on ecosystem dynamics. By contrast, semiarid desert margins receive significant aeolian P from neighboring deserts and are likely influenced by dustborne P additions for the long-term maintenance of productivity. This is particularly true for the semiarid steppes of Africa and Eurasia. The prevalence of large dust sources in Africa and Eurasia indicates that these areas may generally be more influenced by dustborne P additions than soils in the Americas. Significant western hemisphere exceptions to this pattern occur on very old landscapes, such as the forests of the southeastern United States and the Amazon Basin. The Amazon Basin is highly dependent on aeolian deposition for the maintenance of long-term productivity. Dust deposition to terrestrial environments has not been constant with time. Variability in past P deposition related to geologically recent climate change may provide the strongest controls on present and future soil P in the Amazon and elsewhere.},

Our study aims to differentiate old organic matter from young and labile carbon compounds in two acid forest soils (dystric cambisol, haplic podzol). To identify such fractions soil samples were exposed to oxidation with Na2S2O8 and to dissolution by hydrofluoric acid (HF). A negative correlation between 14C activity and carbon release after dissolution of the mineral matrix by HF indicates a strong association of stabilised carbon compounds with the mineral phase. A negative correlation between the 14C activity and the relative proportion of carbon resistant to oxidation by Na2S2O8 shows that young carbon is removed preferentially by this treatment. The fraction remaining after oxidation represents a certain stabilised, long residence time carbon pool. This old fraction comprises between 1 and 30\% of the total soil organic carbon in the surface horizons, but reaches up to 80\% in the sub-surface horizons. Old OC is mainly stabilised by organo-mineral associations with clay minerals and/or iron oxides, whereas intercalation in clay minerals was not found to be important.},

Two-dimensional micro- and nano-scale observations using synchrotron-based Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) and near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy yielded maps of the distribution of C amounts and chemical forms. Carbon deposits were unevenly distributed within microaggregates and did not show any discernable gradients between interior and exterior of aggregates. Rather, C deposits appeared to be patchy within the microaggregates. In contrast to the random location of C, there were micron-scale patterns in the spatial distribution of aliphatic C–H (2922 cm−1), aromatic C=C and N–H (1589 cm−1) and polysaccharide C–O (1035 cm−1). Aliphatic C forms and the ratio of aliphatic C/aromatic C were positively correlated (r2 of 0.66–0.75 and 0.27–0.59, respectively) to the amount of O–H on kaolinite surfaces (3695 cm−1), pointing at a strong role for organo-mineral interactions in C stabilization within microaggregates and at a possible role for molecules containing aliphatic C-H groups in such interactions. This empirical relationship was supported by nanometer-scale observations using NEXAFS which showed that the organic matter in coatings on mineral surfaces had more aliphatic and carboxylic C with spectral characteristics resembling microbial metabolites than the organic matter of the entire microaggregate. Our observations thus support models of C stabilization in which the initially dominant process is adsorption of organics on mineral surfaces rather than occlusion of organic debris by adhering clay particles.},

	abstract = {Saharan dust is shown to enter the Central Amazon Basin (CAB) in bursts which accompany major wet season rain systems. Low-level horizontal convergence feeding these rain systems draws dust from plumes which have crossed the tropical Atlantic under the large-scale circulation fields. Mass exchange of air between the surface and 4 km over the eastern Amazon basin is calculated using rawinsonde data collected during storm events. Mean concentrations of dust observed by aircraft over the western tropical Atlantic are used to calculate the amount of dust injected into the Basin. Individual storm events inject some 480,000 tons of dust into the north-eastern Amazon Basin. Storm and dust climatology suggest that the annual importation of dust is in the order of 13 Mtons. In the north-eastern basin, this may amount to as much as 190 kg ha−1 yr−1. Deposition of trace species, such as phosphate, associated with this dust ranges from 1-4 kg ha−1 yr−1. Uncertainties in these estimates are not believed to be greater than ± 50\% and may be as low as ± 20\%. The deposition fluxes from Saharan dust are essentially identical to the CAB wet deposition fluxes from precipitation in the wet season; a result that implies that the major ionic composition of rain water in the CAB wet season may be strongly influenced by inputs of material originating on the African continent nearly 5000 km away. The total amount of Saharan dust calculated to enter the Amazon basin is 1/2 to 1/3 of that estimated to cross 60°W longitude between 10° and 25°N latitude. We conclude that part of the productivity of the Amazon rain forest is dependent upon critical trace elements contained in the soil dust originating in the Sahara/Sahel. This dependence should be reflected by expansions and contractions of the Amazon rain forest in direct relationship to expansions and contractions of the Sahara/Sahel. Turnover rates for nutrient species deposited with Saharan dust in the Amazon Basin suggest a time scale of 500 to 20,000 years. We believe the dependence of one large ecosystem upon another separated by an ocean and coupled by the atmosphere to be fundamentally important to any view of how the global system functions. Any strategy designed to preserve the Amazonian rain forest or any part thereof should equally concern itself with the inter-relationship between the rain forest, global climate and arid zones well removed from Amazonia.},

	abstract = {Land-use changes are the second largest source of human-induced greenhouse gas emission, mainly due to deforestation in the tropics and subtropics. CO2 emissions result from biomass and soil organic carbon (SOC) losses and may be offset with afforestation programs. However, the effect of land-use changes on SOC is poorly quantified due to insufficient data quality (only SOC concentrations and no SOC stocks, shallow sampling depth) and representativeness. In a global meta-analysis, 385 studies on land-use change in the tropics were explored to estimate the SOC stock changes for all major land-use change types. The highest SOC losses were caused by conversion of primary forest into cropland (−25\%) and perennial crops (−30\%) but forest conversion into grassland also reduced SOC stocks by 12\%. Secondary forests stored less SOC than primary forests (−9\%) underlining the importance of primary forests for C stores. SOC losses are partly reversible if agricultural land is afforested (+29\%) or under cropland fallow (+32\%) and with cropland conversion into grassland (+26\%). Data on soil bulk density are critical in order to estimate SOC stock changes because (i) the bulk density changes with land-use and needs to be accounted for when calculating SOC stocks and (ii) soil sample mass has to be corrected for bulk density changes in order to compare land-use types on the same basis of soil mass. Without soil mass correction, land-use change effects would have been underestimated by 28\%. Land-use change impact on SOC was not restricted to the surface soil, but relative changes were equally high in the subsoil, stressing the importance of sufficiently deep sampling.},

This appears to be particularly true in the tropics where there is a greater proportion of nutrient poor, highly weathered soils that are more susceptible to losses of SOM. Developing management practices that promote the maintenance and storage of SOM in the tropics depends on understanding the factors that control SOM dynamics. This paper describes the role that soil physical properties (mineralogy, texture, and structure) play in regulating the accumulation and loss of SOM in tropical soils. Two different approaches are presented here. The first approach explores relationships between total SOM and soil physical properties in the tropics. These include effects of climate and mineralogy on latitudinal gradients in SOM, interactions between texture and mineralogy as determinants of SOM storage and relationships between SOM and the structural stability of soils. The second approach describes characteristics of SOM associated with different physical constituents of the soil, with particular attention to particle-size fractions and aggregated particles of different sizes. In each case we summarise findings on the distribution of SOM among fractions and characterise its biochemical composition, bioavailability and turnover. Evidence for and against the physical protection of organic matter from microbial attack in tropical soils is also given. Wherever possible, we compare and contrast the findings for tropical soils with those of temperate soils. The influence of landuse management on physical control of SOM dynamics is discussed as an overriding factor with each aproach.},

Mineralization of organic P is influenced by a process referred to as biochemical mineralization wherein hydrolysis of P is repressed by an ample supply of labile P and induced by a limited supply. Pedological P transformations are driven by leaching and increasing acidity which result in the weathering of primary minerals and the formation of secondary minerals. Although the biological cycle is more dynamic than the sluggish pedologic pathway, long-term evolution of P forms in soil ecosystems is controlled by the latter which continually moves P into a sink consisting primarily of occluded P. Occurrence of soluble P as an intermediate during P transformations accommodates translocation of P within soils and landscapes. Because both P content and forms and classes of Soil Taxonomy are related to stage of soil development, a relationship is proposed between taxonomic classes and P forms in soils.},

	abstract = {, Phytate (myo-inositol hexakisphosphate salts)
can constitute a large fraction of the organic P in soils. As a more
recalcitrant form of soil organic P, up to 51 million metric tons
of phytate accumulate in soils annually, corresponding to ∼65\%
of the P fertilizer application. However, the availability of phytate
is limited due to its strong binding to soils via its highly-phosphorylated
inositol structure, with sorption capacity being ∼4 times that
of orthophosphate in soils. Phosphorus (P) is one of the most limiting
macronutrients for agricultural productivity. Given that phosphate
rock is a finite resource, coupled with the increasing difficulty
in its extraction and geopolitical fragility in supply, it is anticipated
that both economic and environmental costs of P fertilizer will greatly
increase. Therefore, optimizing the use of soil phytate-P can potentially
enhance the economic and environmental sustainability of agriculture
production. To increase phytate-P availability in the rhizosphere,
plants and microbes have developed strategies to improve phytate solubility
and mineralization by secreting mobilizing agents including organic
acids and hydrolyzing enzymes including various phytases. Though we
have some understanding of phytate availability and phytase activity
in soils, the limiting steps for phytate-P acquisition by plants proposed
two decades ago remain elusive. Besides, the relative contribution
of plant- and microbe-derived phytases, including those from mycorrhizas,
in improving phytate-P utilization is poorly understood. Hence, it
is important to understand the processes that influence phytate-P
acquisition by plants, thereby developing effective molecular biotechnologies
to enhance the dynamics of phytate in soil. However, from a practical
view, phytate-P acquisition by plants competes with soil P fixation,
so the ability of plants to access stable phytate must be evaluated
from both a plant and soil perspective. Here, we summarize information
on phytate availability in soils and phytate-P acquisition by plants.
In addition, agronomic approaches and biotechnological strategies
to improve soil phytate-P utilization by plants are discussed, and
questions that need further investigation are raised. The information
helps to better improve phytate-P utilization by plants, thereby reducing
P resource inputs and pollution risks to the wider environment.},

	abstract = {Phosphate esters and anhydrides dominate the living world but are seldom used as intermediates by organic chemists. Phosphoric acid is specially adapted for its role in nucleic acids because it can link two nucleotides and still ionize; the resulting negative charge serves both to stabilize the diesters against hydrolysis and to retain the molecules within a lipid membrane. A similar explanation for stability and retention also holds for phosphates that are intermediary metabolites and for phosphates that serve as energy sources. Phosphates with multiple negative charges can react by way of the monomeric metaphosphate ion PO3- as an intermediate. No other residue appears to fulfill the multiple roles of phosphate in biochemistry. Stable, negatively charged phosphates react under catalysis by enzymes; organic chemists, who can only rarely use enzymatic catalysis for their reactions, need more highly reactive intermediates than phosphates.},

As a result, root responses to low phosphate favor the exploration of the shallower part of the soil, where phosphate tends to be more abundant, a strategy described as topsoil foraging. We will review the diverse developmental strategies that can be observed among plants by detailing the effect of phosphate deficiency on primary and lateral roots.

This has been ascribed to the excretion of malic and citric acids from the roots during phosphorus deficiency, resulting in a decrease of the pH in the rhizosphere and a consequent solubilization of the rock phosphate. In this paper the biosynthesis and excretion of organic acids were investigated, partly by comparing physiological reactions to P deficiency of rape with those of an inefficient user of rock phosphate from the same family, hedge mustard (Sisymbrium officinale Scop.). In the leaves of both species, both citrate levels and phosphoenolypyruvate carboxylase were nearly doubled in P–deficient plants, and the citrate/sugar ratio in the phloem exudate into EDTA solution was doubled as well. After exposure of the shoots of rape plants to 14CO2 in the light, the specific activities of citrate in the root and in the nutrient solution were ten times higher than those of malate, and also much higher than the respective activities of citrate in P–sufficient controls. It is suggested that citrate produced in the leaf is exported to the roots, where it is accumulated in the excretion region. Malic acid which is prevailing in the exudate is probably newly–synthesized within the excreting root segment. When no phosphate is supplied, this excretion zone is located 1–2 cm behind the root tips. However, when rock phosphate is applied locally this zone shifts along the root to that part which is in direct contact with the rock phosphate particles. No accumulation and excretion of organic acids could be observed with the roots of P–deficient Sisymbrium.},

Many efforts have been made to understand cooperation between individuals in the same species, while the mechanisms enabling cooperation between different species are less understood. Here, we investigated under strict in vitro culture conditions if the exchange of carbon and phosphorus is pivotal to the cooperation between the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF) Rhizophagus irregularis and the phosphate solubilizing bacterium (PSB) Rahnella aquatilis. We observed that fructose exuded by the AMF stimulated the expression of phosphatase genes in the bacterium as well as the rate of phosphatase release into the growth medium by regulating its protein secretory system. The phosphatase activity was subsequently increased, promoting the mineralization of organic phosphorus (i.e., phytate) into inorganic phosphorus, stimulating simultaneously the processes involved in phosphorus uptake by the AMF. Our results demonstrated for the first time that fructose not only is a carbon source, but also plays a role as a signal molecule triggering bacteria-mediated organic phosphorus mineralization processes. These results highlighted the molecular mechanisms by which the hyphal exudates play a role in maintaining the cooperation between AMF and bacteria.},

White lupin (Lupinus albus L.), field pea (Pisum sativum L.), faba bean (Vicia faba L.) and spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were grown in small sand-filled PVC tubes to create a dense root mat against a 38-μm mesh nylon cloth at the bottom, where it was in contact with the soil of interest contained in another tube. The soil had either not been fertilised (P0) or fertilised with 15 (P15) kg P ha−1 in previous years. The mesh size did not allow roots to grow into the soil, but penetration of root hairs and diffusion of nutrients and root exudates was possible, and a rhizosphere was established. At harvest, thin (1 mm) slices of this rhizosphere soil were cut, down to a 10-mm distance from the mesh surface. The rhizosphere of white lupin, particularly in the P0 treatment, contained citrate, mostly in the first 3 mm, with concentrations decreasing with distance from the root. Acid phosphatase activity was enhanced in the rhizosphere of all species, as compared with bulk soil, up to a distance of 4 mm. Phosphatase activity was highest in the rhizosphere of white lupin, followed by faba bean, field pea and wheat. Both citrate concentrations and phosphatase activities were higher in P0 compared with P15. The depletion of both inorganic (Pi) and organic (Po) phosphorus fractions was greatest at the root surface, and decreased gradually with distance from the root. The soil P fractions that were most depleted as a result of root activity were the bicarbonate-extractable (0.5 M) and sodium hydroxide-extractable (0.1 M) pools, irrespective of plant species. This study suggests that differences among the studied species in use of different P pools and in the width of the rhizosphere are relatively small.},

Recent biochemical studies indicated that AtPAP26, one of 29 PAPs encoded by the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) genome, is the predominant intracellular APase, as well as a major secreted APase isozyme up-regulated by -Pi Arabidopsis. An atpap26 T-DNA insertion mutant lacking AtPAP26 transcripts and 55-kD immunoreactive AtPAP26 polypeptides exhibited: (1) 9- and 5-fold lower shoot and root APase activity, respectively, which did not change in response to Pi starvation, (2) a 40\% decrease in secreted APase activity during Pi deprivation, (3) 35\% and 50\% reductions in free and total Pi concentration, respectively, as well as 5-fold higher anthocyanin levels in shoots of soil-grown -Pi plants, and (4) impaired shoot and root development when subjected to Pi deficiency. By contrast, no deleterious influence of AtPAP26 loss of function occurred under Pi-replete conditions, or during nitrogen or potassium-limited growth, or oxidative stress. Transient expression of AtPAP26-mCherry in Arabidopsis suspension cells verified that AtPAP26 is targeted to the cell vacuole.

Plants have evolved an intricate array of adaptations to enhance Pi acquisition and utilization from their environment. The availability of the complete genome sequence of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, together with a wide assortment of related genomic resources, has significantly advanced our understanding of the adaptations of Pi-starved plants. Information on the genetic identity, subcellular location, biochemical properties, and probable functions of acid phosphatases involved in the Pi metabolism of Pi-starved Arabidopsis is beginning to emerge. Acid phosphatases catalyze the hydrolysis of Pi from a broad range of phosphomonoesters with an acidic pH optimum. The Arabidopsis genome encodes 29 different purple acid phosphatases whose expression is influenced by various developmental and environmental factors. Pi starvation induces de novo synthesis of several extra- and intracellular Arabidopsis purple acid phosphatase isozymes; AtPAP12 and AtPAP26 appear to be the principal root-secreted acid phosphatases that scavenge Pi from extracellular Pi-esters, whereas the dual-targeted AtPAP26 is the predominant intracellular acid phosphatase that functions in vacuolar Pi recycling by Pi-starved Arabidopsis. The identification and functional characterization of intracellular and secreted purple acid phosphatase isozymes upregulated by Pi-deprived plants may help develop strategies for engineering Pi-efficient crops, thereby minimizing the use of unsustainable Pi fertilizers in agriculture.},

Improvement of P acquisition and use by plants is critical for economic, humanitarian and environmental reasons. Plants have evolved a diverse array of strategies to obtain adequate P under limiting conditions, including modifications to root architecture, carbon metabolism and membrane structure, exudation of low molecular weight organic acids, protons and enzymes, and enhanced expression of the numerous genes involved in low-P adaptation. These adaptations may be less pronounced in mycorrhizal-associated plants. The formation of cluster roots under P-stress by the nonmycorrhizal species white lupin (Lupinus albus), and the accompanying biochemical changes exemplify many of the plant adaptations that enhance P acquisition and use. Physiological, biochemical, and molecular studies of white lupin and other species response to P-deficiency have identified targets that may be useful for plant improvement. Genomic approaches involving identification of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) found under low-P stress may also yield target sites for plant improvement. Interdisciplinary studies uniting plant breeding, biochemistry, soil science, and genetics under the large umbrella of genomics are prerequisite for rapid progress in improving nutrient acquisition and use in plants.

	abstract = {In most soils, inorganic phosphorus occurs at fairly low concentrations in the soil solution whilst a large proportion of it is more or less strongly held by diverse soil minerals. Phosphate ions can indeed be adsorbed onto positively charged minerals such as Fe and Al oxides. Phosphate (P) ions can also form a range of minerals in combination with metals such as Ca, Fe and Al. These adsorption/desorption and precipitation/dissolution equilibria control the concentration of P in the soil solution and, thereby, both its chemical mobility and bioavailability. Apart from the concentration of P ions, the major factors that determine those equilibria as well as the speciation of soil P are (i) the pH, (ii) the concentrations of anions that compete with P ions for ligand exchange reactions and (iii) the concentrations of metals (Ca, Fe and Al) that can coprecipitate with P ions. The chemical conditions of the rhizosphere are known to considerably differ from those of the bulk soil, as a consequence of a range of processes that are induced either directly by the activity of plant roots or by the activity of rhizosphere microflora. The aim of this paper is to give an overview of those chemical processes that are directly induced by plant roots and which can affect the concentration of P in the soil solution and, ultimately, the bioavailability of soil inorganic P to plants. Amongst these, the uptake activity of plant roots should be taken into account in the first place. A second group of activities which is of major concern with respect to P bioavailability are those processes that can affect soil pH, such as proton/bicarbonate release (anion/cation balance) and gaseous (O2/CO2) exchanges. Thirdly, the release of root exudates such as organic ligands is another activity of the root that can alter the concentration of P in the soil solution. These various processes and their relative contributions to the changes in the bioavailability of soil inorganic P that can occur in the rhizosphere can considerably vary with (i) plant species, (ii) plant nutritional status and (iii) ambient soil conditions, as will be stressed in this paper. Their possible implications for the understanding and management of P nutrition of plants will be briefly addressed and discussed.},

These responses, however, were temporally distinct. Phosphate influx capacity increased 15-fold in parallel to a 10-fold decrease in endogenous Pi during 7 days of culture in basal growth medium. In contrast, intracellular and cell surface phosphatase activities changed only after alterations in cellular phosphorus status had been in place for a number of days. Even in nutrient sufficient cells the secretion of phosphatase remained relatively high as did the activities of the other phosphatases. The cell surface acid phosphatase had a K(m) of approximately 10 times that of the influx process and molybdate was a much stronger inhibitor of this phosphatase activity. From these results it appears that Pi absorption and the production or activation of phosphatases are regulated in a distinct manner. In addition, Pi uptake into Brassica nigra cells does not appear to directly involve the cell surface phosphatase under Pi-deficient conditions.},

Most of the P applied in fertilizers may be sorbed by soil, and not be available for plants lacking specific adaptations. On the severely P-impoverished soils of south-western Australia and the Cape region in South Africa, non-mycorrhizal species exhibit highly effective adaptations to acquire P. A wide range of these non-mycorrhizal species, belonging to two monocotyledonous and eight dicotyledonous families, produce root clusters. Non-mycorrhizal species with root clusters appear to be particularly effective at accessing P when its availability is extremely low.• Scope There is a need to develop crops that are highly effective at acquiring inorganic P (Pi) from P-sorbing soils. Traits such as those found in non-mycorrhizal root-cluster-bearing species in Australia, South Africa and other P-impoverished environments are highly desirable for future crops. Root clusters combine a specialized structure with a specialized metabolism. Native species with such traits could be domesticated or crossed with existing crop species. An alternative approach would be to develop future crops with root clusters based on knowledge of the genes involved in development and functioning of root clusters.• Conclusions Root clusters offer enormous potential for future research of both a fundamental and a strategic nature. New discoveries of the development and functioning of root clusters in both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous families are essential to produce new crops with superior P-acquisition traits.},

In general, the plants were able to use P from all the organic sources used in the study almost as efficiently as inorganic sources. Dry-matter yield, P uptake, acid and alkaline phosphatase activity and microbial population were increased in all the P treatments. Organic P enhanced alkaline phosphatase activity. Lecithin increased fungal, and phytin bacterial growth. There was no alkaline phosphatase activity in the asepticallly grown clover root exudates. Phosphatase released in aseptic culture after 4 weeks of clover growth was able to efficiently hydrolyse sodium glycerophosphate, lecithin and phytin. The amount of organic P hydrolysed in this and in the soil experiment surpassed plant uptake by a factor of 20.

	abstract = {Phosphodiester linkages, including those that join the nucleotides of DNA, are highly resistant to spontaneous hydrolysis. The rate of water attack at the phosphorus atom of phosphodiesters is known only as an upper limit, based on the hydrolysis of the dimethyl phosphate anion. That reaction was found to proceed at least 99\% by C–O cleavage, at a rate suggesting an upper limit of 10−15 s−1 for P–O cleavage of phosphodiester anions at 25°C. To evaluate the rate enhancement produced by P–O cleaving phosphodiesterases such as staphylococcal nuclease, we decided to establish the actual value of the rate constant for P–O cleavage of a simple phosphodiester anion. In dineopentyl phosphate, C–O cleavage is sterically precluded so that hydrolysis occurs only by P–O cleavage. Measurements at elevated temperatures indicate that the dineopentyl phosphate anion undergoes hydrolysis in water with a t1/2 of 30,000,000 years at 25°C, furnishing an indication of the resistance of the internucleotide linkages of DNA to water attack at phosphorus. These results imply that staphylococcal nuclease (kcat = 95 s−1) enhances the rate of phosphodiester hydrolysis by a factor of ≈1017. In alkaline solution, thymidylyl-3′-5′-thymidine (TpT) has been reported to decompose 105-fold more rapidly than does dineopentyl phosphate. We find however that TpT and thymidine decompose at similar rates and with similar activation parameters, to a similar set of products, at pH 7 and in 1 M KOH. We infer that the decomposition of TpT is initiated by the breakdown of thymidine, not by phosphodiester hydrolysis.},

The rate of spontaneous hydrolysis of phenyl phosphate dianion indicates that a linear free energy relationship reported earlier is reliable for leaving groups whose conjugate acids have pKa values up to at least 10. Using Teflon reaction vessels, it proved possible to follow the hydrolysis of methyl phosphate and 3-(4-carboxy)-2,2-dimethylpropyl phosphate in strong alkali. Even in 1 M KOH, the reaction was found to be specific acid catalyzed. These results establish an upper limit for dianion reactivity, which had been overestimated earlier as a result of the leaching by alkali of silicic acid from quartz reaction vessels. The present findings indicate that the half-time for attack by water on alkyl phosphate dianions is 1.1 × 1012 years (k = 2 × 10−20 s) at 25°C and that phosphatases involved in cell signaling and regulation produce the largest rate enhancements that have been identified thus far.

Lakes represent a large global nutrient sink, modifying the flow of N and P in the environment. It remains unknown, however, the relative retention of these two nutrients in global lakes and their role in the imbalance of the nutrient cycles. Here we compare the ratio between P and N in inflows and outflows of more than 5,000 lakes globally using a combination of nutrient budget model and generalized linear model. We show that over 80\% of global lakes positively retain both N and P, and almost 90\% of the lakes show preferential retention of P. The greater retention of P over N leads to a strong elevation in the ratios between N and P in the lake outflow, exacerbating the imbalance of N and P cycles unexpectedly and potentially leading to biodiversity losses within lakes and algal blooms in downstream N-limited coastal zones. The management of N or P in controlling lake eutrophication has long been debated. Our results suggest that eutrophication management that prioritizes the reduction of P in lakes—which causes a further decrease in P in outflows—may unintentionally aggravate N/P imbalances in global ecosystems. Our results also highlight the importance of nutrient retention stoichiometry in global lake management to benefit watershed and regional biogeochemical cycles.},

Mycelium of eight isolates from four basidiomycete species demonstrated optimal p-nitrophenyl phosphatase activity at pH 4.5 or 5.0. Acid phosphatase activities varied between strains of Scleroderma citrinum and between the species examined. Interspecific differences in isozyme patterns of whole cell extracts were apparent in native polyacrylamide gels. The isoelectric points of the predominant phosphatases in whole cell extracts were in the pH 5.0 to 5.5 range. Growth of fungi on inositol hexaphosphate versus inorganic P did not affect the isozyme patterns detected by either electrophoretic method. Growth on inositol hexaphosphate affected surface and soluble activities towards p-nitrophenyl phosphate and inositol phosphate to different degrees in species examined. Phytase activity was sufficient to produce a net release of P in all isolates. Growth on inositol hexaphosphate was associated with increased uptake of 32P from inositol polyphosphate in four of five species examined. Acid phosphatase, measured with p-nitrophenyl phosphate, was positively correlated with 32P uptake. Decreased phytase activities measured for inositol hexaphosphate grown mycelium were associated with increased P influx in such mycelium. Both phosphatase activity and 32P uptake were subject to inorganic P inhibition with 32P uptake demonstrating a greater sensitivity. These results provide further evidence for the role of surface acid phosphatases in organic P utilization by ectomycorrhizal fungi. Key words: acid phosphatase, ectomycorrhizal fungi, phytase.},

	abstract = {Hydrolysis of phosphate esters is a critical process in the energy metabolism and metabolic regulation of plant cells. This review summarizes the characteristics and putative roles of plant acid phosphatase (APase). Although immunologically closely related, plant APases display remarkable heterogeneity with regards to their kinetic and molecular properties, and subcellular location. The secreted APases of roots and cell cultures are relatively non-specific enzymes that appear to be important in the hydrolysis and mobilization of Pi from extracellular phosphomonoesters for plant nutrition. Intracellular APases are undoubtedly involved in the routine utilization of Pi reserves or other Pi-containing compounds. A special class of intracellular APase exists that demonstrate a clear-cut (but generally nonabsolute) substrate selectivity. These APases are hypothesized to have distinct metabolic functions and include: phytase, phosphoglycolate phosphatase, 3-phosphoglycerate phosphatase, phosphoenolpyruvate phosphatase, and phosphotyrosyl-protein phosphatase. APase expression is regulated by a variety of developmental and environmental factors. Pi starvation induces de novo synthesis of extra- and intracellular APases in cell cultures as well as in whole plants. Recommendations are made to achieve uniformity in the analyses of the different APase isoforms normally encountered within and between different plant tissues.},

In an effort to understand citrate synthesis and organic acid metabolism in proteoid roots of lupin, we have evaluated in vitro enzyme activities of citrate synthase (CS), malate dehydrogenase (MDH), and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) in proteoid and normal roots of plants grown with or without P. Organic acid concentrations, respiration rates, and dark 14CO2-labeling patterns were also determined. The in vitro specific activities of CS, MDH, and PEPC and in vivo dark 14CO2 fixation were higher in proteoid roots compared to normal roots, particularly under P stress. Western blot analysis showed that PEPC enzyme protein was more highly expressed in -P proteoid roots compared to other tissues. The majority of the fixed 14C was found in organic acids, predominantly malate and citrate. A larger fraction of citrate was labeled in P- stressed proteoid roots compared to other root tissue. Respiration rates of proteoid roots were 31\% less than those of normal roots. The data provide evidence for increased synthesis of citrate in proteoid roots compared to normal roots, particularly under P stress. A portion of the carbon for citrate synthesis is derived from nonautotrophic CO2 fixation via PEPC in proteoid roots.},

In the LC, organic acids were accumulated as Casalts extractable with water. In the proteoid rhizosphere of this soil sample 55 μmol citrate and 8 μmol malate per g soil were found. In the Ox, no water extractable organic acids were present. However, determination of citrate in the solid phase of this soil by Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy gave concentrations of 88 and 68 μmol citrate per g soil without and with P application, respectively. Displaced soil solution from the proteoid root rhizosphere of the Ox and the LA increased in Fe and Al concentrations from {\textless}50 μmol/L (soil from reference pots without plants) to more than 600 μmol Fe+Al/L. The concentration of P was increased by a factor of 2 despite of P uptake by the proteoid roots. The mobilization of Al, Fe, and P is attributed to ligand exchange of phosphate against citrate and to the solubilization of Al and Fe as carboxylate complexes.},

	abstract = {Root-induced changes in the rhizosphere may affect mineral nutrition of plants in various ways. Examples for this are changes in rhizosphere pH in response to the source of nitrogen (NH4-N versus NO3-N), and iron and phosphorus deficiency. These pH changes can readily be demonstrated by infiltration of the soil with agar containing a pH indicator. The rhizosphere pH may be as much as 2 units higher or lower than the pH of the bulk soil. Also along the roots distinct differences in rhizosphere pH exist. In response to iron deficiency most plant species in their apical root zones increase the rate of H+ net excretion (acidification), the reducing capacity, the rate of FeIII reduction and iron uptake. Also manganese reduction and uptake is increased several-fold, leading to high manganese concentrations in iron deficient plants. Low-molecular-weight root exudates may enhance mobilization of mineral nutrients in the rhizosphere. In response to iron deficiency, roots of grass species release non-proteinogenic amino acids („phytosiderophores”︁) which dissolve inorganic iron compounds by chelation of FeIII and also mediate the plasma membrane transport of this chelated iron into the roots. A particular mechanism of mobilization of phosphorus in the rhizosphere exists in white lupin (Lupinus albus L.). In this species, phosphorus deficiency induces the formation of so-called proteoid roots. In these root zones sparingly soluble iron and aluminium phosphates are mobilized by the exudation of chelating substances (probably citrate), net excretion of H+ and increase in the reducing capacity. In mixed culture with white lupin, phosphorus uptake per unit root length of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) plants from a soil low in available P is increased, indicating that wheat can take up phosphorus mobilized in the proteoid root zones of lupin. At the rhizoplane and in the root (root homogenates) of several plant species grown in different soils, of the total number of bacteria less than 1 \% are N2-fixing (diazotrophe) bacteria, mainly Enterobacter and Klebsiella. The proportion of the diazotroph bacteria is higher in the rhizosphere soil. This discrimination of diazotroph bacteria in the rhizosphere is increased with foliar application of combined nitrogen. Inoculation with the diazotroph bacteria Azospirillum increases root length and enhances formation of lateral roots and root hairs similarly as does application of auxin (IAA). Thus rhizosphere bacteria such as Azospirillum may affect mineral nutrition and plant growth indirectly rather than by supply of nitrogen.},

It emphasizes recent advances, including the application of novel analytical techniques such as 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and isotope exchange and dilution, and the role of organic P in the transfer of soil P to watercourses in runoff. The transfer of P in drainage from agricultural soils to watercourses is a key component of the global P cycle, and has important implications for water quality, because the enrichment of receiving waters with P can contribute to eutrophication. It is clear that diffuse P pollution cannot be effectively managed without a comprehensive appreciation of the role of organic P. The determination of organic P in drainage waters is almost exclusively based on operationally defined procedures involving size separation and crude chemical speciation.},

	abstract = {The quantification of net soil organic P mineralization rates is hampered by the potentially rapid sorption of released phosphate. Here, isotopic dilution approaches to assess gross and net organic P mineralization rates under steady-state conditions are reviewed, including different analytical and numerical solutions to assess P transformation rates based on incubation experiments with 32P- or 33P-labeled soils. Non-isotopic approaches are also commented on. Published isotopic dilution studies show that isotopically exchangeable P during incubation can partly or even predominantly (20–90\%) result from biological and biochemical rather than physicochemical processes. The relative contribution of biological and biochemical processes tends to be lower in arable soils than under grassland and forests and is negatively related to the availability of inorganic P and positively to concentrations of soil organic carbon. Typical basal gross organic P mineralization rates range between 0.1 and 2.5 mg P kg−1 d−1, but rates up to 12.6 mg P kg−1 d−1 have been observed in grassland and forest soils. The further partitioning of gross organic P mineralization remains uncertain, but a dominance of microbial immobilization and remineralization is likely under most conditions, at least during the initial weeks of incubation. Over longer time periods, the relative importance of mineralization of non-living soil organic P increases, with the contribution of extracellular hydrolysis remaining to be elucidated. This requires other approaches than enzyme activity assays, since measurements of phosphomonoesterase activity in soil render organic P mineralization rates that are one to two orders of magnitude greater than those determined by isotopic dilution. The numerical modeling approach will enable assessment of soil P transformation rates under non-steady-state conditions, where P fluxes are likely to be greater than under steady-state conditions. Ultimately, an improved understanding of the biological and biochemical processes in soil P dynamics may help to improve P management in agroecosystems.},

Nicotiana tabacum plant lines with unique organic anion (OA) and phytase production patterns were used to investigate the effect of OA-driven solubilization on the bioavailability of precipitated and sorbed IHP. Organic anions released IHP sorbed to goethite (Gt) by chelation or reductive dissolution mechanisms in the order: ascorbate {\textgreater} citrate {\textgreater} oxalate {\textgreater} pyruvate {\textgreater} acetate. Transgenic tobacco overexpressing Peniophora lycii phytase (PHY) and a MATE-type citrate transporter (CIT) exuded 2.2- to 2.6-fold higher OA compared with that of wild-type plants. The PHY plants had 33-fold higher exudate phytase activity (6.0 × 10−2 nkat plant−1 day−1) compared with those of wild-type and CIT plants, produced the largest zone of iron-IHP hydrolysis in agar media, and incorporated the most shoot P (2.3 μg) when grown on Gt-IHP. Plants grown on IHP at 2× Gt saturation (0.26 mmol/L) were 10-fold higher in shoot P compared with the 1× Gt condition (0.13 mmol/L IHP) with PHY plants approaching excess P status (1 \% shoot P). The addition of Gt diminished shoot P in plants grown without P (−70 to −80 \%) and with phosphate (−50 \%) or IHP (−100 \%); the exception was the high citrate–exuding plant line (21 nmol citrate plant−1 day−1), for which phosphate uptake was only 20 \% reduced. Plant OA production mitigates P inhibition by Gt when weakly sorbing phosphate species are supplied or when high phytase production by plants can maximize the hydrolysis of IHP.},

Enhancing biodiversity could improve P-use efficiency of grasslands, which is beneficial given that rock-derived P fertilisers are expected to become scarce in the future. Here, we show in a biodiversity experiment that more diverse plant communities were able to exploit P resources more completely than less diverse ones. In the agricultural grasslands that we studied, management effects either overruled or modified the driving role of plant diversity observed in the biodiversity experiment. Nevertheless, we show that greater above- (plants) and belowground (mycorrhizal fungi) biodiversity contributed to tightening the P cycle in agricultural grasslands, as reduced management intensity and the associated increased biodiversity fostered the exploitation of P resources. Our results demonstrate that promoting a high above- and belowground biodiversity has ecological (biodiversity protection) and economical (fertiliser savings) benefits. Such win-win situations for farmers and biodiversity are crucial to convince farmers of the benefits of biodiversity and thus counteract global biodiversity loss.},

The sulfur cycle impacts the global carbon cycle and climate primarily through the remineralization of organic carbon. Over geological timescales, cycling of sulfur is closely tied to the redox state of Earth\&apos;s exosphere through the burial of oxidized (sulfate) and reduced (sulfide) sulfur species in marine sediments. Biological sulfur cycling is associated with isotopic fractionations that can be used to trace the fluxes through various metabolic pathways. The resulting isotopic data provide insights into sulfur cycling in both modern and ancient environments via isotopic signatures in sedimentary sulfate and sulfide phases. Here, we review the deep-time δ34S record of marine sulfates and sulfides in light of recent advances in understanding how isotopic signatures are generated by microbial activity, how these signatures are encoded in marine sediments, and how they may be altered following deposition. The resulting picture shows a sulfur cycle intimately coupled to ambient carbon cycling, where sulfur isotopic records preserved in sedimentary rocks are critically dependent on sedimentological and geochemical conditions (e.g., iron availability) during deposition.},

	doi = {10.2475/ajs.304.10.839},
	abstract = {The surface sulfur reservoir is in intimate contact with the mantle. Over long time scales, exchange with the mantle has influenced the surface reservoir size and possibly its isotopic composition. Processes delivering sulfur to the Earth surface from the mantle include volcanic outgassing, hydrothermal input, and ocean crust weathering. The sulfide fixed in ocean crust as a consequence of hydrothermal sulfate reduction, and subduction of sedimentary sulfides, represent return pathways of sulfur to the mantle. The importance of these different pathways in influencing the size of the surface sulfur reservoir depends on the particulars of ocean and atmosphere chemistry. During times of banded iron formation when the oceans contained dissolved iron, sulfide from submarine hydrothermal activity was precipitated on the seafloor and subsequently subducted back into the mantle and, therefore, had little impact on the surface sulfur reservoir size. With sulfidic ocean bottom water conditions, which may have occurred through long stretches of the Mesoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic, significant amounts of sulfide is subducted into the mantle. When the oceans are oxic, sulfide subduction is unimportant, and an additional source, ocean crust weathering, delivers sulfur to the Earth surface. Thus, under oxic conditions the surface environment accumulates sulfur, and probably has for most of the last 700 million years. Mass balance modeling suggests that the surface sulfur reservoir may have peaked in size in the early Mesoproterozoic, declined to a minimum in the Neoproterozoic, and increased to its present size through the Phanerozoic. The exchange of sulfur between the mantle and the surface environment can also influence the isotopic composition of the surface reservoir. Modeling shows that the subduction of {\textasciicircum}34{\textasciicircum}S-depleted sulfur through the Mesoproterzoic could have significantly increased the average δ{\textasciicircum}34{\textasciicircum}S of the surface reservoir into the late Neoproterozoic. The preserved isotope record through the Neoproterozoic is well out of balance, with the average δ{\textasciicircum}34{\textasciicircum}S for sulfate and sulfide both exceeding the modern crustal average. This imbalance could be explained, at least partly, if the crustal average was more {\textasciicircum}34{\textasciicircum}S-enriched than at present, as the modeling presented here suggests.},

	abstract = {Reduction in soil fertility and depletion of natural resources due to current intensive agricultural practices along with climate changes are the major constraints for crop productivity and global food security. Diverse microbial populations’ inhabiting the soil and rhizosphere participate in biogeochemical cycling of nutrients and thereby, improve soil fertility and plant health, and reduce the adverse impact of synthetic fertilizers on the environment. Sulphur is 4th most common crucial macronutrient required by all organisms including plants, animals, humans and microorganisms. Effective strategies are required to enhance sulphur content in crops for minimizing adverse effects of sulphur deficiency on plants and humans. Various microorganisms are involved in sulphur cycling in soil through oxidation, reduction, mineralization, and immobilization, and volatalization processes of diverse sulphur compounds. Some microorganisms possess the unique ability to oxidize sulphur compounds into plant utilizable sulphate (SO42-) form. Considering the importance of sulphur as a nutrient for crops, many bacteria and fungi involved in sulphur cycling have been characterized from soil and rhizosphere. Some of these microbes have been found to positively affect plant growth and crop yield through multiple mechanisms including the enhanced mobilization of nutrients in soils (i.e., sulphate, phosphorus and nitrogen), production of growth-promoting hormones, inhibition of phytopathogens, protection against oxidative damage and mitigation of abiotic stresses. Application of these beneficial microbes as biofertilizers may reduce the conventional fertilizer application in soils. However, large-scale, well-designed, and long-term field trials are necessary to recommend the use of these microbes for increasing nutrient availability for growth and yield of crop plants. This review discusses the current knowledge regarding sulphur deficiency symptoms in plants, biogeochemical cycling of sulphur and inoculation effects of sulphur oxidizing microbes in improving plant biomass and crop yield in different crops.},

This chapter presents our current knowledge of soluble electron transfer proteins and transmembrane redox complexes that are playing an essential role in the dissimilatory sulfate reduction pathway of SRB of the genus Desulfovibrio. Environmentally important activities displayed by SRB are a consequence of the unique electron transport components or the production of high levels of H2S. The capability of SRB to utilize hydrocarbons in pure cultures and consortia has resulted in using these bacteria for bioremediation of BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene) compounds in contaminated soils. Specific strains of SRB are capable of reducing 3-chlorobenzoate, chloroethenes, or nitroaromatic compounds and this has resulted in proposals to use SRB for bioremediation of environments containing trinitrotoluene and polychloroethenes. Since SRB have displayed dissimilatory reduction of U(VI) and Cr(VI), several biotechnology procedures have been proposed for using SRB in bioremediation of toxic metals. Additional non-specific metal reductase activity has resulted in using SRB for recovery of precious metals (e.g. platinum, palladium and gold) from waste streams. Since bacterially produced sulfide contributes to the souring of oil fields, corrosion of concrete, and discoloration of stonework is a serious problem, there is considerable interest in controlling the sulfidogenic activity of the SRB. The production of biosulfide by SRB has led to immobilization of toxic metals and reduction of textile dyes, although the process remains unresolved, SRB play a role in anaerobic methane oxidation which not only contributes to carbon cycle activities but also depletes an important industrial energy reserve.},

	abstract = {Sulphate reducers have the unique ability to respire using sulphate as an electron acceptor. Sulphate-reducing bacteria and archaea are ubiquitous in the environment. The sulphate reducers that have been isolated and described thus far can be divided into seven phylogenetic lineages, five within the Bacteria and two within the Archaea. Most sulphate reducers belong to approximately 23 genera, with the Gram-negative bacteria belonging to the Deltaproteobacteria and the Gram-positive bacteria within the Clostridia.Sulphate reducers can thrive in a broad range of environmental conditions. They have been detected in shallow marine and freshwater sediments and in deep subsurface environments, such as oil wells, hydrothermal vents and mud volcanoes. They occur in environments with extremely low or high pH, extremely low or high temperature and high or low salt concentrations. They are also present in living organisms, such as ruminants and in the human intestinal tract. In marine worms, they form an intimate relationship with aerobic sulphide-oxidizing bacteria.Sulphate reducers play a key part in the carbon and sulphur cycles. They are extremely versatile with respect to the electron donors and electron acceptors that are used for growth. They can grow in a sulphate-dependent manner using hydrogen and a wide range of organic compounds. However, polymeric compounds (polysaccharides and proteins) are not typically used by sulphate reducers. Although named after their ability to respire using sulphate, other inorganic compounds can also be used as electron acceptors. Some sulphate reducers can even respire with oxygen.In environmental biotechnology, sulphate reducers have an important role. One unwanted effect is the production of hydrogen sulphide in anaerobic digesters that are used for waste and waste-water treatment and its role in the corrosion of iron and steel. However, sulphate reducers are also beneficially used in biotechnological processes to remove heavy metals and oxidized sulphur compounds from gas and water. In nature, sulphate reducers live in close vicinity with other microorganisms, which results in metabolic interactions with other anaerobes. In the presence of sulphate, they compete with methanogens and acetogens for common substrates, such as hydrogen and acetate. In the absence of sulphate, however, sulphate reducers grow acetogenically in syntrophy with methanogens. The complete genomes of different sulphate reducers have been, or are currently being, sequenced. Comparative analysis of these genome sequences will provide important information on their carbon and sulphur metabolism and open up the possibility for functional genomics.},

	abstract = {The mechanism of the initial steps of pyrite (100) surface oxidation was investigated in detail by means of density functional theory/plane-wave calculations. Pyrite oxidation is related to many environmental and technological issues, and its mechanism has not been completely understood. A chemical picture of the pyrite oxidation process in the presence of oxygen and water was proposed in the present investigation. The reaction steps of the oxidation mechanism can be separated into two types. Type I reactions present lower activation energies and are redox processes that involve oxidation of two Fe(II) sites on the surface to form predominantly the Fe(III)–OH–. This species is formed from hydrogen transfer between the adsorbed water to the adsorbed oxygen molecule on the Fe(II) sites. Type II reactions present higher activation energies and lead to the formation of a S═O bond through the hydrogen atom transference from a water molecule to the Fe(III)–OH– species, forming Fe(II)–OH2. These reactions present higher activation energies. The determinant step of this oxidation mechanism involves the formation of two adsorbed hydroxide species (OH–) on the surface. The hydroxides in the presence of water from the bulk liquid react to form two water molecules adsorbed on the surface and the first S–O chemical bond. Parallel reactions were investigated explaining the experimental detection of the O2– and OOH– species. Furthermore, the proposed mechanism explains the experimental observation that the oxygen present in the sulfate is mostly originated from water instead of an oxygen molecule. The present study strengthens the importance of the water/solid interface to understand the oxidation mechanism of pyrite in the presence of water at a molecular level.},

Because only one or, at most, two electrons can be transferred at a time, the overall oxidation process is quite complex.

The reaction at the cathodic sites is the rate-determining step for the overall process. This paper maps out the most important steps in this overall process.},

	abstract = {Stable isotope ratios of sulfur (δ34S) and oxygen (δ18O) in marine sulfate respond to changes in fluxes and processes in the global sulfur cycle. The two isotope systems respond on different time scales to different factors affecting the global sulfur cycle. Sulfur isotopes respond primarily to the relative fluxes of weathering-derived sulfate to the oceans versus the net flux of sulfur exported from the oceans as pyrite in marine sediments. At the present day, this response is relatively slow (∼20 Ma) because of the large size of the marine sulfate reservoir; ancient oceans had lower sulfate concentrations and thus sulfate residence times may have been shorter. The δ34S of marine sulfate is also sensitive to the development of a significant reservoir of H2S in ancient stratified oceans. Sulfate–oxygen isotopes respond primarily to changes in the cycling of sulfur in the oceans and marine sediments. Sulfur disproportionation, oxic and anaerobic sulfide oxidation all impart different δ18O signatures to marine sulfate; the relative importance of these different processes is in turn controlled by the distribution of redox conditions and microbial ecology of sea-floor sediments. The mutual interpretation of changes in marine sulfate δ34S and δ18O can thus give rather precise information on the nature of changes in global sulfur cycling. Recently, records of isotope compositions of ancient marine sulfate have become available through the analysis of carbonate-associated sulfate (CAS) in limestones and marine biogenic barite, both of which provide far more continuous records than previous data based primarily on marine evaporite sulfate minerals. We review a number of case studies which use sulfur or combined sulfur and oxygen isotopic records derived from CAS and biogenic barite. Proterozoic CAS-sulfur isotope datasets often show marked variations over very small stratigraphic intervals (e.g. 20‰ over 300 m). When examined in conjunction with estimates of deposition rates, they are used to infer a new evolutionary curve of marine sulfate concentrations and therefore a protracted oxidation of the Earth's biosphere. Through the Cretaceous–Tertiary interval, the marine sulfate–sulfur record is characterised by significant periods of relative stability punctuated by phases of more rapid change (limited to 7‰ variation over the last 130 Ma). The Carboniferous was characterized essentially by a gradual change of 9‰ over 60 Ma. By contrast, at the Permian–Triassic boundary, extreme changes occur over very short geological time scales (14‰ over {\textless}1 Ma); simple mass balance considerations suggest the development of a large, relatively short-lived, reservoir of H2S in the oceanic water column at this time. In this case, it is the short time scale of the response of the sulfate–oxygen record that enables the interpretation of rapid changes in oceanic redox state. Over the last 10 Ma, sulfate–oxygen δ18O in biogenic barite exhibits large isotope changes (∼7‰) that occur independently of those in sulfate–sulfur. These changes must reflect changes in depositional/redox environment at the ocean margins and/or changes in microbial cycling of sulfur, but the exact cause remains controversial. Our limited understanding of the influence of redox environment and sediment microbial ecology on sulfur cycling currently restricts the level to which we are able to interpret such changes in marine sulfate δ18O.},

	abstract = {The correlation between large igneous provinces (LIPs), extinction events, and rapid climate change suggests that volcanism can have a detrimental impact on Earth surface conditions. Changes in atmospheric and ocean chemistry, particularly the climate-sensitive carbon and sulphur cycles, are among the most probable processes for inducing global environmental stress. However, the interactions and feedbacks between volcanism and these cycles are numerous and complex, making the characterisation of the response to a LIP challenging. Here we summarise the sources and sinks of carbon and sulphur from large scale volcanism and magmatism using information from modern and ancient systems. For the sources, we review the current understanding of volcanic emissions, and explore the relative contributions and importance of magma-derived degassing versus volatile release from sediments affected by igneous intrusions and lava. In addition, we explore the various ways in which LIPs can reduce atmospheric concentrations of these same elements. The relative influences of each source and sink are in part determined by the mode of LIP emplacement and eruption style, along with the subsequent timescales of such effects. We focus on a few key examples, including the Siberian Traps, the Paraná-Etendeka, and the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP), to demonstrate how the environmental impact can vary considerably with differing modes of emplacement, LIP duration, and eruption styles. In particular, we show that the host rocks can have a dominant role as a source or sink of emissions, depending on the lithologies affected by the LIP emplacement.},

	abstract = {The bacterial reduction of sulphate to sulphide at the sea bed is a key process in the oceanic sulphur cycle, and is responsible for the oxidation of organic matter which becomes buried below the oxic and sub-oxic zones of the sea bed. The oxic surface layer of the sea bed varies in thickness from a few millimetres in sheltered coastal areas to ⩾1 m in pelagic sediments1,2. Below this layer, organic matter is mineralized mainly by fermenting, denitrifying, sulphate-reducing and methane-producing bacteria. Sulphate reduction is the predominant terminal step in the mineralization processes of sulphate-rich shelf sediments where the sulphate reducers inhibit the methanogens by competing with them for common substrates3–5. Sulphate reduction may therefore have a quantitatively important role in the overall oxidation of organic matter in the sea bed. Recently, concurrent measurements of oxygen uptake and sulphate reduction in a coastal sediment6 have demonstrated the importance of the sulphate-reducing bacteria in the mineralization of organic carbon. I present here the first comparative survey of aerobic and anaerobic mineralization in the sea bed based on direct rate measurements of the two processes. The results demonstrate a surprisingly high contribution from the sulphate-reducers. In coastal sediments, this specialized group of bacteria oxidized as much organic matter to CO2 as did all the aerobic organisms. Their relative contribution decreased three fold over the continental shelf from the shore to a depth of 200 m.},

	abstract = {The anti-stress molecule dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP) is made in vast quantities — about 1 billion tonnes per year — by many single-celled plankton and some algal seaweeds; when it is released by these organisms into the oceans, it is a food source for many marine bacteria. The importance of the associated catabolic biotransformations in the global sulphur cycle is all the more great because one of the products, the volatile dimethyl sulphide (DMS), has several environmental effects, ranging from the initiation of cloud cover by some of its oxidation products to its ability to act as a chemoattractant for many marine animals.Recent genetic and genomic analyses of several marine bacteria have provided many insights into the mechanisms of DMSP catabolism. These insights include an unexpected amount of diversity in the enzymatic mechanisms and the regulation involved, and in the identities of the microorganisms that can degrade DMSP.The dmd genes that encode enzymes of the demethylation pathway for DMSP catabolism occur in many strains of abundant marine alphaproteobacteria known as the roseobacters and also in the world's most populous group of marine bacteria, the SAR11 clade. These genes are therefore widespread in metagenomic data sets from marine environments. The demethylation pathway that was revealed by molecular genetics differed from that which had been previously predicted.Another series of catabolic pathways involves the cleavage of DMSP by enzymes known generically as DMSP lyases, which generate dimethyl sulphide (DMS) as a primary product. A total of six enzymes, encoded by their corresponding ddd genes, were identified in different bacteria, and these differ with regard to their polypeptide families, their subcellular locations (one of them, DddY, is in the periplasm) and the identities of their catabolites. DddD generates 3-hydroxypropionate (3HP), whereas the other five — DddL, DddP, DddQ, DddW and DddY — give rise to acrylate.Several ddd genes that encode different DMSP lyases are subject to horizontal gene transfer, in some cases between taxonomically diverse organisms. For example, DddP occurs not only in roseobacters, but also sporadically in other distantly related marine bacteria and, more remarkably, in some fungal pathogens.Some individual bacteria have multiple ways of catabolizing DMSP. This feature is most prevalent in the roseobacters, several strains of which contain the DMSP demethylase and one or more different DMSP lyases. These different mechanisms may be adapted to particular environmental conditions.In several bacteria, the regulation of DMSP cleavage is unusual, as the catabolic products, acrylate or 3HP, can act as co-inducers of the ddd genes and, hence, of the DMS-producing phenotype. Although the substrate DMSP may seem to be an effective co-inducer in some species, it must first be converted to one of the bona fide inducer molecules.},

Marine algae produce dimethylsulfonium propionate (DMSP), which has an osmoregulating function but may also be enzymatically cleaved to yield the volatile dimethylsulfide (DMS). Attempts to identify the variables which control the oceanic production of DMS have shown that there are no simple relationships with algal biomass or primary productivity, but suggest that the concentration of DMS in the ocean is regulated by a complicated interplay of algal speciation and trophic interactions. Part of the biogenically produced DMS diffuses into the atmosphere, where it is oxidized, mostly to aerosol sulfate. The ability of these aerosol particles to nucleate cloud droplets, and thereby influence the reflectivity and stability of clouds, forms the basis of a proposed geophysiological feedback loop involving phytoplankton, atmospheric sulfur, and climate. Carbonylsulfide (COS) is produced photochemically from dissolved organic matter in seawater. The mechanism of this reaction is still unknown. Diffusion of COS from the ocean to the atmosphere is a globally significant source of this gas, which participates in the stratospheric ozone cycle. Hydrogen sulfide and carbon disulfide are produced in the surface ocean by still unidentified processes, which appear to be related to biogenic activity. For these gases, the oceans are a minor source to the troposphere.},

Dimethyl sulphide has been studied intensely for its role in regulating global climate8–11 and is produced by phytoplankton in response to zooplankton grazing12. Zooplankton, including Antarctic krill (Euphamia super ha)13, are in turn eaten by seabirds and other animals14. Results from controlled behavioural experiments performed at sea show that many Procellariiforms can detect dimethyl sulphide, and that some species (for example, storm petrels) are highly attracted to it.

No major low molecular weight carbohydrates were found in Cyclotella. Sucrose was not detected in the algal extracts. Only P. tricornutum synthesized the tertiary sulphonium compound, β-dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP), and the quantity of this solute in the alga was dependent on the amount of NaCl in the medium.

	abstract = {Seawater concentrations of the climate-cooling, volatile sulphur compound dimethylsulphide (DMS) are the result of numerous production and consumption processes within the marine ecosystem. Due to this complex nature, it is difficult to predict temporal and geographical distribution patterns of DMS concentrations and the inclusion of DMS into global ocean climate models has only been attempted recently. Comparisons between individual model predictions, and ground-truthing exercises revealed that information on the functional relationships between physical and chemical ecosystem parameters, biological productivity and the production and consumption of DMS and its precursor dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP) is necessary to further refine future climate models. In this review an attempt is made to quantify these functional relationships. The description of processes includes: (1) parameters controlling DMSP production such as species composition and abiotic factors; (2) the conversion of DMSP to DMS by algal and bacterial enzymes; (3) the fate of DMSP-sulphur due to, e.g., grazing, microbial consumption and sedimentation and (4) factors controlling DMS removal from the water column such as microbial consumption, photo-oxidation and emission to the atmosphere. We recommend the differentiation of six phytoplankton groups for inclusion in future models: eukaryotic and prokaryotic picoplankton, diatoms, dinoflagellates, and other phytoflagellates with and without DMSP-lyase activity. These functional groups are characterised by their cell size, DMSP content, DMSP-lyase activity and interactions with herbivorous grazers. In this review, emphasis is given to ecosystems dominated by the globally relevant haptophytes Emiliania huxleyi and Phaeocystis sp., which are important DMS and DMSP producers.},

	abstract = {Dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), a key component of the global geochemical sulfur cycle, is a secondary metabolite produced in large quantities by marine phytoplankton and utilized as an osmoprotectant, thermoprotectant, and antioxidant. Marine bacteria can use two pathways to degrade and catabolize DMSP, a demethylation pathway and a cleavage pathway that produces the climate-active gas dimethylsulfide (DMS). Whether marine bacteria can also accumulate DMSP as an osmoprotectant to maintain the turgor pressure of the cell in response to changes in external osmolarity has received little attention. The marine halophile Vibrio parahaemolyticus contains at least six osmolyte transporters, namely four betaine carnitine choline transport (BCCT) carriers (BccT1 to BccT4) and two ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family ProU transporters. In this study, we showed that DMSP is used as an osmoprotectant by V. parahaemolyticus and by several other Vibrio species, including Vibrio cholerae and Vibrio vulnificus. Using a V. parahaemolyticus proU double mutant, we demonstrated that these ABC transporters are not required for DMSP uptake. However, a bccT null mutant lacking all four BCCTs had a growth defect compared to the wild type (WT) in high-salinity medium supplemented with DMSP. Using mutants possessing only one functional BCCT in growth pattern assays, we identified two BCCT family transporters, BccT1 and BccT2, that are carriers of DMSP. The only V. parahaemolyticus BccT homolog that V. cholerae and V. vulnificus possess is BccT3, and functional complementation in Escherichia coli MKH13 showed that V. cholerae VcBccT3 could transport DMSP. In V. vulnificus strains, we identified and characterized an additional BCCT family transporter, which we named BccT5, that was also a carrier for DMSP.IMPORTANCE DMSP is present in the marine environment, produced in large quantities by marine phytoplankton as an osmoprotectant, and is an important component of the global geochemical sulfur cycle. This algal osmolyte has not been previously investigated for its role in marine heterotrophic bacterial osmotic stress response. Vibrionaceae species are marine species, many of which are halophiles exemplified by V. parahaemolyticus, a species that possesses at least six transporters for the uptake of osmolytes. Here, we demonstrated that V. parahaemolyticus and other Vibrio species can accumulate DMSP as an osmoprotectant and show that several BCCT family transporters uptake DMSP. These studies suggest that DMSP is a significant bacterial osmoprotectant that may be important for understanding the fate of DMSP in the environment. DMSP is produced and present in coral mucus, and Vibrio species form part of the microbial communities associated with corals. The function of DMSP in these interactions is unclear, but it could be an important driver for these associations, allowing Vibrio proliferation. This work suggests that DMSP likely has a more important role in heterotrophic bacteria ecology than previously appreciated.},

Here, we describe a widespread symbiotic association between Acantharia biomineralizing microorganisms that are abundant grazers in plankton communities, and members of the haptophyte genus Phaeocystis that are cosmopolitan bloom-forming microalgae. Cophylogenetic analyses demonstrate that symbiont biogeography, rather than host taxonomy, is the main determinant of the association. Molecular dating places the origin of this photosymbiosis in the Jurassic (ca. 175 Mya), a period of accentuated marine oligotrophy. Measurements of intracellular dimethylated sulfur indicate that the host likely profits from antioxidant protection provided by the symbionts as an adaptation to life in transparent oligotrophic surface waters. In contrast to terrestrial and marine symbioses characterized to date, the symbiont reported in this association is extremely abundant and ecologically active in its free-living phase. In the vast and barren open ocean, partnership with photosymbionts that have extensive free-living populations is likely an advantageous strategy for hosts that rely on such interactions. Discovery of the Acantharia-Phaeocystis association contrasts with the widely held view that symbionts are specialized organisms that are rare and ecologically passive outside the host.},

Here, we show that the generalist dinoflagellate parasitoid Parvilucifera sinerae (Perkinsozoa, Alveolata) is activated from dormancy, not only by Alexandrium minutum cells but also by culture filtrates. We unequivocally identified the algal metabolite dimethylsulphide (DMS) as the density-dependent cue of the presence of potential host. This allows the parasitoid to alternate between a sporangium-hosted dormant stage and a chemically-activated, free-living virulent stage. DMS-rich exudates of resistant dinoflagellates also induced parasitoid activation, which we interpret as an example of coevolutionary arms race between parasitoid and host. These results further expand the involvement of dimethylated sulphur compounds in marine chemical ecology, where they have been described as foraging cues and chemoattractants for mammals, turtles, birds, fish, invertebrates and plankton microbes.},

The cleavage products of DMSP, dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and acrylic acid (AA), accumulated during viral infection of both strains, confirming that viral lysis of algae can lead directly to DMSP cleavage. AA and DMS accumulated in parallel with compromised E. huxleyi cells, indicating that DMSP cleavage occurred during the physical disruption of the infected cells. This is in agreement with the hypothesis that DMSP and DMSP lyase ([DL] the enzyme responsible for cleaving DMSP) are segregated in healthy or undamaged cells. During grazing, the concentrations of DMS and AA produced per eaten cell were an order of magnitude higher than the concentrations resulting from cell death caused by viral infection, suggesting that grazing is the quantitatively more significant pathway of DMS production in E. huxleyi. Levels of DL activity decreased in infected cultures to a minimum of 0.00065 fmol cell−1 min−1 as compared with an average of 0.09 fmol cell−1 min−1 in the control cultures, indicating that reduced DL activity in virally infected cells was responsible for the lower levels of DMSP cleavage observed during viral lysis.},

	abstract = {Several bloom-forming marine algae produce concentrated intracellular dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) and display high DMSP cleavage activity in vitro and during lysis after grazing or viral attack. Here we show evidence for cleavage of DMSP in response to environmental cues among different strains of the haptophyte Emiliania huxleyi (Lohmann) Hay et Mohler and the dinoflagellate Alexandrium spp. (Halim). Sparging or shaking live cells of either taxon increased dimethyl sulfide (DMS), especially in dinoflagellates, known to be very sensitive to shear stresses. Additions of polyamines, known triggers of exocytosis in some protists, also stimulated DMSP cleavage in a dose-responsive manner. We observed DMS production by some algae after shifts in light regime. When most exponential-phase E. huxleyi were transferred to continuous darkness, cells decreased in volume and DMSP content within 24 h; DMSP content per unit cell volume remained relatively steady. DMS accumulated as long as cells remained in the dark, but on returning to a light:dark cycle DMS accumulation ceased within 24 h. However, E. huxleyi strain CCMP 373, containing highly active in vitro DMSP lyase, produced only transient accumulations of DMS in the dark. This was apparently due to production and concomitant oxidation or uptake of DMS, because cells of this strain rapidly removed DMS added to cultures. Three strains of the dinoflagellate Alexandrium tamarense containing high in vitro DMSP lyase activity showed no DMS production in the dark, and all appeared to remove additions of DMS. Alexandrium tamarense strain CCMP 1771 also removed dimethyl disulfide, an inhibitor of bacterial DMS consumption. These data suggest that physical or chemical cues can trigger algal DMSP cleavage, but DMS production may be masked by subsequent oxidation and/or uptake.},

	abstract = {The potentially significant role of the biogenic trace gas dimethylsulfide (DMS) in determining the Earth's radiation budget makes it necessary to accurately reproduce seawater DMS distribution and quantify its global flux across the sea/air interface. Following a threefold increase of data (from 15,000 to over 47,000) in the global surface ocean DMS database over the last decade, new global monthly climatologies of surface ocean DMS concentration and sea-to-air emission flux are presented as updates of those constructed 10 years ago. Interpolation/extrapolation techniques were applied to project the discrete concentration data onto a first guess field based on Longhurst's biogeographic provinces. Further objective analysis allowed us to obtain the final monthly maps. The new climatology projects DMS concentrations typically in the range of 1–7 nM, with higher levels occurring in the high latitudes, and with a general trend toward increasing concentration in summer. The increased size and distribution of the observations in the DMS database have produced in the new climatology substantially lower DMS concentrations in the polar latitudes and generally higher DMS concentrations in regions that were severely undersampled 10 years ago, such as the southern Indian Ocean. Using the new DMS concentration climatology in conjunction with state-of-the-art parameterizations for the sea/air gas transfer velocity and climatological wind fields, we estimate that 28.1 (17.6–34.4) Tg of sulfur are transferred from the oceans into the atmosphere annually in the form of DMS. This represents a global emission increase of 17\% with respect to the equivalent calculation using the previous climatology. This new DMS climatology represents a valuable tool for atmospheric chemistry, climate, and Earth System models.},

Both clones had detectable DMSP lyase activity, as measured by production of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) during in vitro assays of crude cell preparations, but activities and conditions differed considerably between clones. Clone 373 had high activity; clone 370 had low activity and required chloride. For both strains, enzyme activity per cell was constant during exponential growth, but little DMS was produced by healthy cells. Rather, DMS production was activated when cells were subjected to physical or chemical stresses that caused cell lysis. We propose that DMSP lyase and DMSP are segregated within these cells and reaction only under conditions that result in cell stress or damage. Such activation occurs during microzooplankton grazing. When these clones were grazed by the dinoflagellate Oxyrrhis marina, DMS was produced; ungrazed cells, as well as those exposed to grazer exudates and associated bacteria, generated no DMS. Grazing of clone 373 produced much more DMS than grazing of clone 370, consistent with their relative in vitro DMSP lyase activities. DMS was only generated when cells were actually being grazed, indicating that ingested cells were responsible for the DMS formation. We suggest that even low levels of grazing can greatly accelerate DMS production.},

	abstract = {Field and laboratory studies of anoxic sediments from Cape Lookout Bight, North Carolina, suggest that anaerobic methane oxidation is mediated by a consortium of methanogenic and sulfate-reducing bacteria. A seasonal survey of methane oxidation and CO2 reduction rates indicates that methane production was confined to sulfate-depleted sediments at all times of year, while methane oxidation occurred in two modes. In the summer, methane oxidation was confined to sulfate-depleted sediments and occurred at rates lower than those of CO2 reduction. In the winter, net methane oxidation occurred in an interval at the base of the sulfate-containing zone. Sediment incubation experiments suggest both methanogens and sulfate reducers were responsible for the observed methane oxidation. In one incubation experiment both modes of oxidation were partially inhibited by 2-bromoethanesulfonic acid (a specific inhibitor of methanogens). This evidence, along with the apparent confinement of methane oxidation to sulfate-depleted sediments in the summer, indicates that methanogenic bacteria are involved in methane oxidation. In a second incubation experiment, net methane oxidation was induced by adding sulfate to homogenized methanogenic sediments, suggesting that sulfate reducers also play a role in the process. We hypothesize that methanogens oxidize methane and produce hydrogen via a reversal of CO2 reduction. The hydrogen is efficiently removed and maintained at low concentrations by sulfate reducers. Pore water H2 concentrations in the sediment incubation experiments (while net methane oxidation was occurring) were low enough that methanogenic bacteria could derive sufficient energy for growth from the oxidation of methane. The methanogen-sulfate reducer consortium is consistent not only with the results of this study, but may also be a feasible mechanism for previously documented anaerobic methane oxidation in both freshwater and marine environments.},

In this study, we compared results of rRNA gene (rDNA) surveys and lipid analyses of archaea and bacteria associated with methane seep sediments from several different sites on the Californian continental margin. Two distinct archaeal lineages (ANME-1 and ANME-2), peripherally related to the orderMethanosarcinales, were consistently associated with methane seep marine sediments. The same sediments contained abundant13C-depleted archaeal lipids, indicating that one or both of these archaeal groups are members of anaerobic methane-oxidizing consortia. 13C-depleted lipids and the signature 16S rDNAs for these archaeal groups were absent in nearby control sediments. Concurrent surveys of bacterial rDNAs revealed a predominance of δ-proteobacteria, in particular, close relatives ofDesulfosarcina variabilis. Biomarker analyses of the same sediments showed bacterial fatty acids with strong 13C depletion that are likely products of these sulfate-reducing bacteria. Consistent with these observations, whole-cell fluorescent in situ hybridization revealed aggregations of ANME-2 archaea and sulfate-reducing Desulfosarcina andDesulfococcus species. Additionally, the presence of abundant 13C-depleted ether lipids, presumed to be of bacterial origin but unrelated to ether lipids of members of the orderDesulfosarcinales, suggests the participation of additional bacterial groups in the methane-oxidizing process. Although theDesulfosarcinales and ANME-2 consortia appear to participate in the anaerobic oxidation of methane in marine sediments, our data suggest that other bacteria and archaea are also involved in methane oxidation in these environments.},

	abstract = {Protists include all eukaryotes except plants, fungi and animals. They are an essential, yet often forgotten, component of the soil microbiome. Method developments have now furthered our understanding of the real taxonomic and functional diversity of soil protists. They occupy key roles in microbial foodwebs as consumers of bacteria, fungi and other small eukaryotes. As parasites of plants, animals and even of larger protists, they regulate populations and shape communities. Pathogenic forms play a major role in public health issues as human parasites, or act as agricultural pests. Predatory soil protists release nutrients enhancing plant growth. Soil protists are of key importance for our understanding of eukaryotic evolution and microbial biogeography. Soil protists are also useful in applied research as bioindicators of soil quality, as models in ecotoxicology and as potential biofertilizers and biocontrol agents. In this review, we provide an overview of the enormous morphological, taxonomical and functional diversity of soil protists, and discuss current challenges and opportunities in soil protistology. Research in soil biology would clearly benefit from incorporating more protistology alongside the study of bacteria, fungi and animals.},

However, protists have received far less attention than other components of the soil microbiome. We used amplicon sequencing of soils from 180 locations across six continents to investigate the ecological preferences of protists and their functional contributions to belowground systems. We complemented these analyses with shotgun metagenomic sequencing of 46 soils to validate the identities of the more abundant protist lineages. We found that most soils are dominated by consumers, although parasites and phototrophs are particularly abundant in tropical and arid ecosystems, respectively. The best predictors of protist composition (primarily annual precipitation) are fundamentally distinct from those shaping bacterial and archaeal communities (namely, soil pH). Some protists and bacteria co-occur globally, highlighting the potential importance of these largely undescribed belowground interactions. Together, this study allowed us to identify the most abundant and ubiquitous protists living in soil, with our work providing a cross-ecosystem perspective on the factors structuring soil protist communities and their likely contributions to soil functioning.},

Here we review important issues that remain to be resolved. Current rules governing validation of new species, from various codes of nomenclature, have become an impediment to naming of new protists. Standard requirements for protist species descriptions and type specimens need to be modernized to accommodate the rapid discovery of new species made possible by modern microscopic and molecular techniques. Although we agree with the criticisms of the botanical and zoological codes made by proponents of the Phylocode, we did not all agree that the current Phylocode is the solution, nor does it currently address species typification.

In addition to taxa known to be dominant in soil, including Cercozoa and Ciliophora, we found high relative abundances of groups such as Apicomplexa and Dinophyceae that have not previously been recognized as being important components of soil microbial communities. Soil protistan communities were highly diverse, approaching the extreme diversity of their bacterial counterparts across the same sites. Like bacterial taxa, protistan taxa were not globally distributed, and the composition of these communities diverged considerably across large geographic distances. However, soil protistan and bacterial communities exhibit very different global-scale biogeographical patterns, with protistan communities strongly structured by climatic conditions that regulate annual soil moisture availability.},

	abstract = {All nutrients that plants absorb have to pass a region of intense interactions between roots, microorganisms and animals, termed the rhizosphere. Plants allocate a great portion of their photosynthetically fixed carbon to root-infecting symbionts, such asmycorrhizal fungi; another part is released as exudates fuelling mainly free-living rhizobacteria. Rhizobacteria are strongly top-down regulated by microfaunal grazers, particularly protozoa. Consequently, beneficial effects of protozoa on plant growth have been assigned to nutrients released from consumed bacterial biomass, that is, the ‘microbial loop’. In recent years however, the recognition of bacterial communication networks, the common exchange of microbial signals with roots and the fact that these signals are used to enhance the efflux of carbon from roots have revolutionized our view of rhizosphere processes. Most importantly, effects of rhizobacteria on root architecture seem to be driven in large by protozoan grazers. Protozoan effects on plant root systems stand in sharp contrast to effects of mycorrhizal fungi. Because the regulation of root architecture is a key determinant of nutrient- and water-use efficiency in plants, protozoa provide a model system that may considerably advance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying plant growth and community composition.},

The effect of small additions of glucose or ammonium nitrate or both, twice a week was also tested. Plant dry weight and N-content, number of microorganisms and biomass plus inorganic N were determined after 6 weeks. The introduction of plants profoundly influenced the N transformations. In the presence of root-derived carbon, much more N was mineralized from the organic matter and immobilized mainly in plant biomass. “Total observable change in biomass N plus inorganic N” was negative in the unvegetated soils without additions, while a mineralization of 1.7 mg N microcosm−1 was observed in microcosms with wheat plants grown with bacteria only. When protozoa were included, the N taken up by plants increased by 75\%. Sugar additions resulted in an 18\% increase of total N in the shoots when protozoa were present, but had no significant effect in the absence of grazers. Plants with the same root weight were more efficient in their uptake of inorganic N when protozoa were present. Plants grown with protozoa also had a lower R/S ratio, indicating a less stressed N availability situation. The lowest ratio was found with N additions in the presence of protozoa. The results indicate that, with energy supplied by plant roots or with external glucose additions, soil bacteria can mineralize N from the soil organic matter to support their own growth. Grazing of the bacteria is necessary to make bacterial biomass N available for plant uptake.},

A soil suspension from which the protozoa were eliminated by filtration or chloroform fumigation was used as a control. After 19 weeks of growth in a climate chamber at 20–22°C, the seedlings were harvested. Protozoa reduced the number of bacterial colony-forming units extracted from the rhizoplane of both non-mycorrhizal and mycorrhizal seedlings and significantly increased seedling growth. However, concentrations of mineral nutrients in needles were not increased in seedlings with protozoan treatment. It is concluded that the increased growth of seedling was not caused by nutrients released during amoebal grazing on rhizosphere micro-organisms. The protozoa presumably affected plant physiological processes, either directly, via production of phytohormones, or indirectly, via modification of the structure and performance of the rhizosphere microflora and their impact on plant growth. Mycorrhizal colonization significantly increased the abundance of naked amoebae at the rhizoplane.

Experimental chambers were planted with the grass Hordelymus europeaus L. (Poaceae) and three compartments separated by 45-μm mesh were established: rhizosphere, intermediate and non-rhizosphere. The experiment lasted for 16 weeks and the following parameters were measured at the end of the experiment: shoot and root mass of H. europaeus, carbon and nitrogen content in shoots and roots, density of ciliates, amoebae, flagellates and nematodes, microbial biomass (SIR), basal respiration, streptomycin sensitive respiration, ammonium and nitrate contents, phosphate content of soil compartments. In addition, leaching of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) and leachate pH were measured at regular intervals in leachate obtained from suction cups in the experimental chambers. Protozoa stimulated the recovery of nitrifying bacteria following defaunation (by chloroform fumigation) and increased nitrogen losses as nitrate in leachate. In contrast, protozoa and nematodes reduced leaching of phosphate, an effect ascribed to stimulation of microbial growth early in the experiment. Earthworms strongly increased the amount of extractable mineral nitrogen whereas it was strongly reduced by protozoa and nematodes. Both protozoa and nematodes reduced the stimulatory effect of earthworms on nitrogen mineralization. Microbial biomass, basal respiration, and numbers of protozoa and nematodes increased in the vicinity of the root. Protozoa generally caused a decrease in microbial biomass whereas nematodes and earthworms reduced microbial biomass only in the absence of protozoa. None of the animals studied significantly affected basal respiration, but specific respiration of microorganisms (O2 consumption per unit biomass) was generally higher in animal treatments. The stimulatory effect of nematodes and earthworms, however, occurred only in the absence of protozoa. The sensitivity of respiration to streptomycin suggested that protozoa selectively grazed on bacterial biomass but the bacterial/fungal ratio appeared to be unaffected by grazing of P. pellio. Earthworms reduced root biomass of H. europaeus, although shoot biomass remained unaffected, and concentrations of nitrogen in shoots and particularly in roots were strongly increased by earthworms. Both nematodes and protozoa increased plant biomass, particularly that of roots. This increase in plant biomass was accompanied by a marked decrease in nitrogen concentrations in roots and to a lesser extent in shoots. Generally, the effects of protozoa on plant growth considerably exceeded those of nematodes. It is concluded that nematodes and protozoa stimulated plant growth by non-nutritional effects, whereas the effects of earthworms were caused by an increase in nutrient supply to H. europaeus.},

In particular, the role of the soil fauna interacting with rhizosphere micro-organisms and plant roots has so far found little attention.

Shifts in the microbial community structure were evaluated by analysing phospholipid fatty acids. Protozoa and AM fungi enhanced plant N uptake. Protozoa mobilized N from bacterial biomass and AM fungi increased the translocation of the mobilized N to the host plant; if both were present, plant biomass, C fixation and C allocation to roots increased twofold.

Decomposition of a 15N/13C, dual-labelled, organic patch in the absence of plant roots was also examined. In the decomposing patch the amounts of 13C and 15N remaining co-varied and both declined with time. Nematode numbers increased. However, protozoan biomass and inorganic N (NO3− and NH4+) availability did not significantly alter as decomposition of the patch progressed. Addition of inorganic N patches, as NH4NO3 solutions, to the first lateral to emerge from the main seminal root axis of Lolium perenne L. seedlings had no effect on root growth compared with controls 16 d after addition. Protozoan biomass increased. Furthermore, log protozoan biomass and NO3− concentrations of the growth medium were significantly (P{\textless}0·05) and positively related. Plant response (i.e. biomass production, N capture and root length) to an added organic patch was examined using five different grass species (Festuca arundinacea L., Phleum pratense L., Poa pratensis L., Dactylis glomerata L. and L. perenne). Total plant biomass was significantly (P{\textless}0·05) repressed by an organic patch. Plant N content was reduced when an organic patch was present but N concentrations were greater. Roots were generally slow to proliferate within the patch but there was a significant (P{\textless}0·05) species×patch interaction for root length within the patch at harvest and in the 2-cm band below it. However, 15N capture by the plants was not related to mean root length duration. All species captured similar amounts of 15N (c. 3–5\%) at harvest as a percentage of the initial 15N added in the organic patch. Similarly, the percentage of the total N captured from the patch was not related to the proportion of the root weight within the patch. The fraction of the captured N from the organic patch as a percentage of the plants' total N, however, did differ among species. Substantial amounts ({\textgreater}62\%) of the 15N initially added remained in the patch at harvest. Much less (c. 13–21\%) 13C remained in the patch. Protozoan biomass and nematode numbers increased significantly (P{\textless}0·05) in the organic patch, although the relationship between the two groups was not significant. As in the inorganic N study, the relationship between log protozoan biomass and NO3− concentrations in the soil was significantly positive. We conclude that, when grown in monoculture, plants' N capture from an organic patch is not a simple function of root proliferation. External factors, not plant attributes, are more important in controlling patch exploitation.},

The presence of Acanthamoebae (Protozoa: Amoebida) induced changes in root morphology of watercress seedlings as soon as the root protruded from the seed. The root system was greater and more branched. These changes resembled hormonal effects and were accompanied by an increase in the proportion of auxin, indolyl-3-acetic acid (IAA) producing rhizosphere bacteria. IAA did not originate from amoebal metabolism, but resulted from changes in the composition and activity of the microbial community. Therefore, amoebae affected both the functioning and turnover of rhizosphere microoganisms. We propose a new mechanism based on hormonal effects of protozoa on root growth. Protozoa function as bacteria-mediated mutualists promoting plant growth by hormonal feed-back mechanisms and nutrient effects based on nutrient release from grazed bacterial biomass, i.e. the microbial-loop.},

	abstract = {Soils can contain large amounts of microbial biomass, including fungi, protists, viruses, bacteria and archaea. Most of these taxa currently remain undescribed, and have physiological and ecological attributes that are unknown.Soil microbial communities are highly diverse, in part because soil environmental conditions are so heterogeneous. In a single soil there is a wide range of distinct microbial habitats that contain unique microbial assemblages.Spatial variability in the structure of soil microbial communities is typically larger than the temporal variability. The composition of soil bacterial communities and the abundances of specific taxa are often predictable from soil and site characteristics, including soil pH, climate and organic carbon availability.Plants can clearly have important direct or indirect effects on soil microbial communities and vice versa. However, the effects of plant species on microbial taxa are often difficult to predict a priori owing, in part, to plant associations with soil microorganisms being highly context-dependent.Linking specific soil microbial processes to specific microbial taxa remains difficult. One way to tackle this problem is to use genomic data to group microbial taxa according to shared similar life-history strategies and functional attributes.Given recent methodological and conceptual advances, the field is poised to rapidly advance our understanding of the soil microbiome. Promising future research directions include cultivation-based analyses of soil microbial taxa, studies of soil viruses and investigations into the importance of horizontal gene transfer in shaping the soil microbiome.},

	abstract = {We investigated the effects of soil microfauna feeding on a soil bacterium (Pseudomonas cepacia) and the resultant influence on net N mineralization. As the bacterial biomass increased, it assimilated N from the soil. Later, only if this bacterial biomass decreased was N remineralized. Grazing by amoebae (Acanthamoeba polyphaga) always reduced bacterial biomass, increased respiration, and increased nitrogen mineralization. Grazing by nematodes (Mesodiplogaster lheritieri) always reduced bacterial numbers and increased respiration, but only increased N mineralization when nematode populations themselves declined from peak values. A N budget calculated for the populations indicated that the nematode biomass was not sufficient to account for the unmineralized N, so we postulate change in excretory pathways as the bacterial food becomes limiting. This budget further indicated that amoebal and bacterial biomass could account for all of the non-mineral N when only these two species were present. Our experiments showed that microfauna can play an important role in N mineralization in soil and that the mechanism for this role is more likely to be through direct excretion by the grazers than through indirect physiological effects on the bacteria.},

Traditional cultivation-based methods miss a majority of taxa, whereas molecular barcoding approaches employing PCR introduce significant biases in reported community composition of soil protists. Here, we applied a metatranscriptomic approach to assess the protist community in 12 mineral and organic soil samples from different vegetation types and climatic zones using small subunit ribosomal RNA transcripts as marker. We detected a broad diversity of soil protists spanning across all known eukaryotic supergroups and revealed a strikingly different community composition than shown before. Protist communities differed strongly between sites, with Rhizaria and Amoebozoa dominating in forest and grassland soils, while Alveolata were most abundant in peat soils. The Amoebozoa were comprised of Tubulinea, followed with decreasing abundance by Discosea, Variosea and Mycetozoa. Transcripts of Oomycetes, Apicomplexa and Ichthyosporea suggest soil as reservoir of parasitic protist taxa. Further, Foraminifera and Choanoflagellida were ubiquitously detected, showing that these typically marine and freshwater protists are autochthonous members of the soil microbiota. To the best of our knowledge, this metatranscriptomic study provides the most comprehensive picture of active protist communities in soils to date, which is essential to target the ecological roles of protists in the complex soil system.},

It is unknown if similar hyperdiversity patterns are reflected at the microbial scale with unicellular eukaryotes (protists). Here we show, using environmental metabarcoding of soil samples and a phylogeny-aware cleaning step, that protist communities in Neotropical rainforests are hyperdiverse and dominated by the parasitic Apicomplexa, which infect arthropods and other animals. These host-specific parasites potentially contribute to the high animal diversity in the forests by reducing population growth in a density-dependent manner. By contrast, too few operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of Oomycota were found to broadly drive high tropical tree diversity in a host-specific manner under the Janzen-Connell model. Extremely high OTU diversity and high heterogeneity between samples within the same forests suggest that protists, not arthropods, are the most diverse eukaryotes in tropical rainforests. Our data show that protists play a large role in tropical terrestrial ecosystems long viewed as being dominated by macroorganisms.},

These microbes are keystone organisms of soil ecosystems and regulate essential processes of soil fertility such as nutrient cycling and plant growth. Despite this, protists have received little scientific attention, especially compared to bacteria, fungi and nematodes in soil studies. Recent methodological advances, particularly in molecular biology techniques, have made the study of soil protists more accessible, and have created a resurgence of interest in soil protistology. This ongoing revolution now enables comprehensive investigations of the structure and functioning of soil protist communities, paving the way to a new era in soil biology. Instead of providing an exhaustive review, we provide a synthesis of research gaps that should be prioritized in future studies of soil protistology to guide this rapidly developing research area. Based on a synthesis of expert opinion we propose 30 key questions covering a broad range of topics including evolution, phylogenetics, functional ecology, macroecology, paleoecology, and methodologies. These questions highlight a diversity of topics that will establish soil protistology as a hub discipline connecting different fundamental and applied fields such as ecology, biogeography, evolution, plant-microbe interactions, agronomy, and conservation biology.

	abstract = {Lateral roots are crucial for the plasticity of root responses to environmental conditions in soil. The bacterivorous microfauna has been shown to increase root branching and to foster auxin producing soil bacteria. However, information on modifications of plant internal auxin content by soil bacteria and bacterivores is missing. Therefore, the effects of a rhizosphere bacterial community and a common soil amoeba (Acanthamoeba castellanii) on root branching and on auxin (indole-3-acetic acid) metabolism in Lepidium sativum and Arabidopsis thaliana were investigated. In a first experimental series, bacteria increased conjugated auxin concentrations in L. sativum shoots, but did not alter free bioactive auxin content nor root branching. In contrast, in presence of soil bacteria plus amoebae free auxin concentrations in shoots and root branching increased, demonstrating that effects of bacteria on auxin metabolism in plants were strongly modified by the bacterivorous amoebae. In a second experiment, A. thaliana reporter plants for auxin (DR5) and cytokinin (ARR5) responded similarly with increased root branching in the presence of amoebae. Surprisingly, in reporter plants cytokinin but not auxin responses were detectable, accompanied by higher soil nitrate concentrations in the presence of amoebae. Likely, increased nitrate concentrations in the rhizosphere led to an accumulation of cytokinin and interactions with free auxin in plants and finally to increased root growth in the presence of amoebae. Altogether, the results show that mutual control mechanisms exist between plant hormone metabolism and microbial signalling, and that effects on hormonal concentrations of plants by free-living bacteria are strongly influenced by bacterial grazers like amoebae.},

	abstract = {Plant health largely depends on root-associated microorganisms that inhibit pathogens. Enriching the rhizosphere microbiome with beneficial bacteria has a high potential of supporting future sustainable food production. However, the introduced microorganisms often show low activity with a low survival rate. We propose to solve this limitation by co-inoculating beneficial bacteria with protists. Free-living protists are one of the main regulators of bacterial activity in the rhizosphere and can increase the density and activity of pathogen-suppressive microbes. We therefore hypothesized that protist-bacteria interactions may serve to enhance plant protection against soil-borne pathogens. We tested whether co-inoculating beneficial bacteria with protists increases plant protection against Fusarium solani S55, a fungal pathogen causing root rot. We inoculated Vicia faba seedlings with the disease-suppressing bacteria Rahnella aquatilis B16C and Pseudomonas yamanorum B12, alone or in combination with three different bacterivorous soil protists, Rosculus terrestris S14D1, Bodomorpha sp. C10D3 and Cercomonas lenta C5D5. We grew plants in Fusarium-infested soil and recorded the effect of inoculation on disease severity and pathogen density. We demonstrated that introduced bacteria and protists synergistically impact plant health. When introduced alone, both bacteria and protists provided a partial protection against Fusarium rot. Protists further modulated the performance of the bacteria in an idiosyncratic way, with some combinations offering an almost complete Fusarium solani S55 suppression. These results suggest that protists could form the base of a new generation of biological control strategies of soil-borne diseases, either as a standalone inoculant or as an enhancer of beneficial bacteria.},

This symbiosis requires the formation of new root structures called nodules. Besides rhizobia, nodules host several microbial species that may serve to enhance plant growth and disease resistance. In this study, we demonstrate that several endophytic bacteria isolated from nodules harbour plant growth promotion and biocontrol traits. A collection of 120 bacterial strains isolated from Faba bean (Vicia faba) and chickpea (Cicer arietinum) nodules were screened for their ability to inhibit phytopathogenic Fusarium solani on “In vitro” antibiosis tests. Sixteen best effective isolates were selected, identified and sequences were deposited in Genbank. These strains were all isolated from Faba bean nodules. These have the characteristics to produce siderophores and auxin as well as expression of some genes coding the production of the antibiotic compounds as Pyrrolnitrin (PRN), Phenazine (PHZ)… Based on the former PGPR and biocontrol characteristics, three strains; Rahnella aquatilis B16C, Pseudomonas yamanorum B12 and Pseudomonas fluorescens B8P were analyzed for their “In vivo” biocontrol potential in suppressing F. solani root rot of three cultivars of Faba bean under greenhouse conditions. The three strains significantly reduced the pathogen symptom severity. R. aquatilis B16C showed the best protecting potentiality with the three Faba bean cultivars and it is consequently, suggested as biocontrol agent for field application. Then again, our study confirms previous suggestion of legume nodules as untapped suitable source of beneficial microorganisms that can be used to control pathogens in a sustainable way.},

We investigated the role of the MB complex for protozoan effects on plant growth. First, the MB complex formed by 16 rice cultivars belonging to different ecotypes and subspecies were quantified. These cultivars were subsequently used to investigate protozoan effects on plant growth. The differences between the highest and lowest MB complex producers were 3.1 and 5.3 times for fully hydrated mucilage and RBCs, respectively. Mucilage production and RBCs showed a significant positive regression (R2=0.92) in Japonica. Presence of protozoa generally enhanced shoot biomass, lateral root growth and plant nitrogen uptake. Further, upland cultivars showed significantly higher growth enhancement than lowland cultivars in presence of protozoa. A significant positive regression between MB complex and increased lateral root growth by amoeba revealed that the MB complex facilitated protozoan effects on plant growth, which is the first evidence for a new functional role of the MB complex.},

Currently, many nematicides have been banned or are being phased out in Europe and other parts of the world because of environmental and human health concerns. Therefore, we need to focus on sustainable and alternative methods of nematode control to protect crops. Plant roots contain and release a wide range of bioactive secondary metabolites, many of which are known defense compounds. Hence, profound understanding of the root mediated interactions between plants and plant parasitic nematodes may contribute to efficient control and management of pest nematodes. In this review, we have compiled literature that documents effects of root metabolites on plant parasitic nematodes. These chemical compounds act as either nematode attractants, repellents, hatching stimulants or inhibitors. We have summarized the few studies that describe how root metabolites regulate the expression of nematode genes. As non-herbivorous nematodes contribute to decomposition, nutrient mineralization, microbial community structuring and control of herbivorous insect larvae, we also review the impact of plant metabolites on these non-target organisms.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The resulting maps show that 4.4 ± 0.64 × 1020 nematodes (with a total biomass of approximately 0.3 gigatonnes) inhabit surface soils across the world, with higher abundances in sub-Arctic regions (38\% of total) than in temperate (24\%) or tropical (21\%) regions. Regional variations in these global trends also provide insights into local patterns of soil fertility and functioning. These high-resolution models provide the first steps towards representing soil ecological processes in global biogeochemical models and will enable the prediction of elemental cycling under current and future climate scenarios.},

	abstract = {Nematodes are aquatic organisms that depend on thin water films to live and move within existing pathways of soil pores of 25–100 μm diameter. Soil nematodes can be a tool for testing ecological hypotheses and understanding biological mechanisms in soil because of their central role in the soil food web and linkage to ecological processes. Ecological succession is one of the most tested community ecology concepts, and a variety of nematode community indices have been proposed for purposes of environmental monitoring. In contrast, theories of biogeography, colonization, optimal foraging, and niche partitioning by nematodes are poorly understood. Ecological hypotheses related to strategies of coexistence of nematode species sharing the same resource have potential uses for more effective biological control and use of organic amendments to foster disease suppression. Essential research is needed on nematodes in natural and agricultural soils to synchronize nutrient release and availability relative to plant needs, to test ecological hypotheses, to apply optimal foraging and niche partitioning strategies for more effective biological control, to blend organic amendments to foster disease suppression, to monitor environmental and restoration status, and to develop better predictive models for land-use decisions.},

In this paper we present highlights of their development for control of insect pests above and below ground. The target insects include those from foliar, soil surface, cryptic and subterranean habitats. Advances in mass-production and formulation technology of EPNs, the discovery of numerous efficacious isolates/strains, and the desirability of reducing pesticide usage have resulted in a surge of commercial use and development of EPNs. Commercially produced EPNs are currently in use for control of scarab larvae in lawns and turf, fungus gnats in mushroom production, invasive mole crickets in lawn and turf, black vine weevil in nursery plants, and Diaprepes root weevil in citrus in addition to other pest insects. However, demonstrated successful control of several other insects, often has not lead to capture of a significant share of the pesticide market for these pests.},

The community structures of two groups of mites were studied (Acari: Mesostigmata, Oribatida) from a tailing pond, using transect method, in correlation with concentrations of heavy metals (As, Cu, Pb, Ni, Mn and Zn), with abiotic factors (altitude, aspect, soil temperature, soil humidity, soil pH) and biotic factor (vegetation coverage). Taking into account the mite communities, in total, 30 mite species were identified, with 1009 individuals and 18 immatures (10 species with 59 individuals, 5 immatures of Mesostigmata and 20 species with 950 individuals, 13 immatures of Oribatida). The investigated habitats from the tailing pond were grouped in five transects, with different degree of pollution, based on total metal loads. Taking into account of the connection between mites communities, abiotic factors and heavy metals, each transect were characterized through specific relationship. Using multivariate statistical analysis, we revealed that the occurrence of some Oribatida species was strongly correlated with vegetation coverage, soil pH and soil humidity, though concentrations of Cu, As, Mn, Ni and Zn also had an influence. Pb and Zn concentrations were shown to influence the occurrence of Mesostigmata mites. The heterogeneity of mites species richness at 2 m2 scale was correlated with a metric related to the heterogeneity of heavy metals at the same scale.},

	abstract = {Knowledge of the trophic ecology of soil animals is important for understanding their high alpha diversity as well as their functional role in soil food webs and systems. In the last 20 years, the analysis of natural variations in stable isotope ratios (15N/14N, 13C/12C) has revolutionized our view on soil animal trophic ecology. Here, we review the state of the art of the trophic ecology of a highly abundant and diverse soil animal taxon, oribatid mites (Oribatida), investigated by stable isotope analyses. The review is based on 25 papers reporting stable isotope data of 292 oribatid mite taxa from 30 different sites. Four main findings emerged. (1) Oribatid mites cluster into six trophic groups, i.e. moss feeders, lichen feeders, primary decomposers, fungal feeders/secondary decomposers, predators/scavengers and marine algal feeders, plus one additional group, which incorporates CaCO3 in their cuticle for defence but still belongs to the fungal feeders/secondary decomposers group. (2) Of the 292 species studied 43.7\% were classified as fungal feeders/secondary decomposers, 27.0\% as primary decomposers and 15.7\% as predators/scavengers, only few species include CaCO3 into their skeleton (6.1\%), feed on lichens (4.9\%), mosses (2.1\%) or marine algae (0.7\%). (3) In about one-third of the species studied the trophic niche was constant or varied little between sites or habitats, but in two-thirds of the species their trophic niche varied between habitats, with some species even shifting trophic levels, indicating trophic plasticity. (4) When aggregated at higher taxonomic level oribatid mite species clustered in only three instead of six trophic groups. This indicates that species within the same high level taxon often belong to different trophic groups, for example because feeding habits evolved convergently. Therefore, to accurately reflect the trophic ecology of oribatid mites their stable isotope signatures need to be analysed at species level. However, stable isotope analyses also have limitations, e.g. feeding on bacteria and fungi cannot be separated, and the same is true for feeding on ectomycorrhizal and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Other methods such as fatty acid, amino acid and molecular gut content analyses as well as microbiome analyses may complement stable isotope studies and resolve oribatid mite trophic niche differentiation at a higher resolution. This will contribute to a better understanding of the local coexistence of large numbers of species in soil. Finally, we provide perspectives on how to integrate microarthropods into soil food webs using stable isotope and other methods allowing deeper insight into their trophic structure.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Biosecurity in agriculture is essential for preventing the introduction and spread of plant-parasitic nematodes (PPNs) which threaten global food security by reducing crop yields and facilitating disease spread. These risks are exacerbated by increased global trade and climate change, which may alter PPN distribution and activity, increasing their impact on agricultural systems. Addressing these challenges is vital to maintaining the integrity of the food supply chain. This review highlights significant advancements in managing PPN-related biosecurity risks within the food supply chain, particularly considering climate change’s evolving influence. It discusses the PPN modes of transmission, factors increasing the risk of infestation, the impact of PPNs on food safety and security, and traditional and emerging approaches for detecting and managing these pests. Literature suggests that implementing advanced biosecurity measures could decrease PPN infestation rates by up to 70\%, substantially reducing crop yield losses and bolstering food security. Notably, the adoption of modern detection and management techniques, (molecular diagnostics and integrated pest management) and emerging geospatial surveillance and analysis systems (spectral imaging, change-detection analysis) has shown greater effectiveness than traditional methods. These innovations offer promising avenues for enhancing crop health and securing the food supply chain against environmental shifts. The integration of these strategies is crucial, demonstrating the potential to transform biosecurity practices and sustain agricultural productivity in the face of changing climatic conditions. This analysis emphasizes the importance of adopting advanced measures to protect crop health and ensure food supply chain resilience, providing valuable insights for stakeholders across the agricultural sector.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In contrast to the size of the genus, the majority of past research focused on a small number of species, i.e., the so-called ‘major’ species M. arenaria, M. hapla, M. incognita, and M. javanica. This review highlights recent work aimed at ‘minor’ root-knot nematodes: M. chitwoodi, M. fallax, M. minor, M. enterolobii (=M. mayaguensis), M. exigua, and M. paranaensis. Some of these species have been described only recently. After a brief profile of each species, identification methods and their application in Meloidogyne spp. are summarized. Intraspecific variation and its impact on plant resistance breeding are discussed and interactions between M. enterolobii and Fusarium solani are highlighted as an example of synergistic interactions with other plant pathogens. Future research on Meloidogyne spp. is not only shaped by recent breakthroughs such as completing the genome sequences of M. hapla and M. incognita, but is also influenced by changes in agriculture. Taken together, the aim of this review is to draw attention to previously neglected and newly described Meloidogyne spp. that are developing into major problems for agriculture in tropical and temperate climates.},

A systematic approach to the organisation, curation, analysis and presentation of these data is clearly vital for maximising the utility of these data to researchers. We have developed a portal called WormBase ParaSite (http://parasite.wormbase.org) for interrogating helminth genomes on a large scale. Data from over 100 nematode and platyhelminth species are integrated, adding value by way of systematic and consistent functional annotation (e.g. protein domains and Gene Ontology terms), gene expression analysis (e.g. alignment of life-stage specific transcriptome data sets), and comparative analysis (e.g. orthologues and paralogues). We provide several ways of exploring the data, including genome browsers, genome and gene summary pages, text search, sequence search, a query wizard, bulk downloads, and programmatic interfaces. In this review, we provide an overview of the back-end infrastructure and analysis behind WormBase ParaSite, and the displays and tools available to users for interrogating helminth genomic data.},

	abstract = {Sedentary plant-parasitic nematodes (PPNs) establish specialized feeding cells within roots to maintain long-term relationships with their hosts. However, feeding cells degenerate prematurely in plants that harbor resistance (R) genes against these parasites reducing their life span and ability to reproduce. Recognition of the nematode, mediated directly or indirectly by plant R proteins, occurs via nematode secreted effectors and evokes a resistance response, which is referred to as effector-triggered immunity (ETI). Recent breakthroughs in nematode effector biology shed new light on key players mediating ETI and have identified those involved in plant defense suppression as novel targets for engineering resistance in transgenic plants. Advances in plant genetics and genomics has facilitated the discovery of R genes to nematodes. Nevertheless, underlying resistance mechanisms remain poorly understood and are confounded by recently identified R genes that do not fit previously proposed paradigms. Thus, there is still much to be learned about how plants fight off underground attacks from PPNs. In coming years, we can expect breakthroughs in our understanding of the nature and mechanisms of plant resistance and nematode virulence as we explore these novel R genes.},

	abstract = {The embryonic cell lineage of Caenorhabditis elegans has been traced from zygote to newly hatched larva, with the result that the entire cell lineage of this organism is now known. During embryogenesis 671 cells are generated; in the hermaphrodite 113 of these (in the male 111) undergo programmed death and the remainder either differentiate terminally or become postembryonic blast cells. The embryonic lineage is highly invariant, as are the fates of the cells to which it gives rise. In spite of the fixed relationship between cell ancestry and cell fate, the correlation between them lacks much obvious pattern. Thus, although most neurons arise from the embryonic ectoderm, some are produced by the mesoderm and a few are sisters to muscles; again, lineal boundaries do not necessarily coincide with functional boundaries. Nevertheless, cell ablation experiments (as well as previous cell isolation experiments) demonstrate substantial cell autonomy in at least some sections of embryogenesis. We conclude that the cell lineage itself, complex as it is, plays an important role in determining cell fate. We discuss the origin of the repeat units (partial segments) in the body wall, the generation of the various orders of symmetry, the analysis of the lineage in terms of sublineages, and evolutionary implications.},

	abstract = {The number of nongonadal nuclei in the free-living soil nematode Caenorhabditis elegans increases from about 550 in the newly hatched larva to about 810 in the mature hermaphrodite and to about 970 in the mature male. The pattern of cell divisions which leads to this increase is essentially invariant among individuals; rigidly determined cell lineages generate a fixed number of progeny cells of strictly specified fates. These lineages range in length from one to eight sequential divisions and lead to significant developmental changes in the neuronal, muscular, hypodermal, and digestive systems. Frequently, several blast cells follow the same asymmetric program of divisions; lineally equivalent progeny of such cells generally differentiate into functionally equivalent cells. We have determined these cell lineages by direct observation of the divisions, migrations, and deaths of individual cells in living nematodes. Many of the cell lineages are involved in sexual maturation. At hatching, the hermaphrodite and male are almost identical morphologically; by the adult stage, gross anatomical differences are obvious. Some of these sexual differences arise from blast cells whose division patterns are initially identical in the male and in the hermaphrodite but later diverge. In the hermaphrodite, these cells produce structures used in egg-laying and mating, whereas, in the male, they produce morphologically different structures which function before and during copulation. In addition, development of the male involves a number of lineages derived from cells which do not divide in the hermaphrodite. Similar postembryonic developmental events occur in other nematode species.},

	abstract = {Naturally occurring entomopathogens are important regulatory factors in insect populations. Many species are employed as biological control agents of insect pests in row and glasshouse crops, orchards, ornamentals, range, turf and lawn, stored products, and forestry and for abatement of pest and vector insects of veterinary and medical importance. The comparison of entomopathogens with conventional chemical pesticides is usually solely from the perspective of their efficacy and cost. In addition to efficacy, the advantages of use of microbial control agents are numerous. These include safety for humans and other nontarget organisms, reduction of pesticide residues in food, preservation of other natural enemies, and increased biodiversity in managed ecosystems. As with predators and parasitoids, there are three basic approaches for use of entomopathogens as microbial control agents: classical biological control, augmentation, and conservation. The use of a virus (Oryctes nonoccluded virus), a fungus (Entomophaga maimaiga), and a nematode (Deladenus siricidicola) as innoculatively applied biological control agents for the long-term suppression of palm rhinoceros beetle (Oryctes rhinoceros), gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar), and woodwasp (Sirex noctilio), respectively, has been successful. Most examples of microbial control involve inundative application of entomopathogens. The most widely used microbial control agent is the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis. The discovery of new varieties with activity against Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, and Diptera and their genetic improvement has enhanced the utility of this species. Recent developments in its molecular biology, mode of action, and resistance management are reviewed. Examples of the use, benefits, and limitations of entomopathogenic viruses, bacteria, fungi, nematodes, and protozoa as inundatively applied microbial control agents are presented. Microbial control agents can be effective and serve as alternatives to broad-spectrum chemical insecticides. However, their increased utilization will require (1) increased pathogen virulence and speed of kill; (2) improved pathogen performance under challenging environmental conditions (cool weather, dry conditions, etc.); (3) greater efficiency in their production; (4) improvements in formulation that enable ease of application, increased environmental persistence, and longer shelf life; (5) better understanding of how they will fit into integrated systems and their interaction with the environment and other integrated pest management (IPM) components; (6) greater appreciation of their environmental advantages; and (7) acceptance by growers and the general public. We envision a broader appreciation for the attributes of entomopathogens in the near to distant future and expect to see synergistic combinations of microbial control agents with other technologies. However, if future development is only market driven, there will be considerable delays in the implementation of several microbial control agents that have excellent potential for use in IPM programs.},

In contrast, root exudates prepared from marigold, pepper, or soybean seedlings were attractive to H. glycines but were repellent to M. incognita. Root extracts had the same effect as exudates. Fractionation of exudates by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (acetonitrile [CH3CN] and 0.1\% trifluoroacetic acid) revealed highly polar and less polar components affecting behaviors. Fractions eluting at 12\% CH3CN from all three plants attracted H. glycines and repelled M. incognita.

Free-living infective juveniles (IJs) of EPNs employ host-seeking behaviors to locate suitable hosts for infection. We found that EPNs can differentiate between naïve and infected hosts, and that host attractiveness changes over time in a species-specific manner. We used solid-phase microextraction and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry to identify volatile chemical cues that may relay information about a potential host’s infection status and resource availability. Among the chemicals identified from the headspace of infected hosts, 3-Methyl-2-buten-1-ol (prenol) and 3-Hydroxy-2-butanone (AMC) were selected for further behavioral assays due to their temporal correlation with the behavioral changes of IJs towards the infected hosts. Both compounds were repulsive to IJs of Steinernema glaseri and S. riobrave in a dose-dependent manner when applied on an agar substrate. Furthermore, the repulsive effects of prenol were maintained when co-presented with the uninfected host odors, overriding attraction to uninfected hosts. Prenol was attractive to dauers of some free-living nematodes and insect larvae. These data suggest that host-associated chemical cues may have several implications in EPN biology, not only as signals for avoidance and dispersal of conspecifics, but also as attractants for new potential hosts.},

	abstract = {Soil invertebrates (i.e., soil fauna) are important drivers of many key processes in soils including soil aggregate formation, water retention, and soil organic matter transformation. Many soil fauna groups directly or indirectly participate in litter consumption. However, the quantity of litter consumed by major faunal groups across biomes remains unknown. To estimate this quantity, we reviewed {\textgreater} 1000 observations from 70 studies that determined the biomass of soil fauna across various biomes and 200 observations from 44 studies on litter consumption by soil fauna. To compare litter consumption with annual litterfall, we analyzed 692 observations from 24 litterfall studies and 183 observations from 28 litter stock studies. The biomass of faunal groups was highest in temperate grasslands and then decreased in the following order: boreal forest {\textgreater} temperate forest {\textgreater} tropical grassland {\textgreater} tundra {\textgreater} tropical forest {\textgreater} Mediterranean ecosystems {\textgreater} desert and semidesert. Tropical grasslands, desert biomes, and Mediterranean ecosystems were dominated by termites. Temperate grasslands were dominated by omnivores, while temperate forests were dominated by earthworms. On average, estimated litter consumption (relative to total litter input) ranged from a low of 14.9\% in deserts to a high of 100.4\% in temperate grassland. Litter consumption by soil fauna was greater in grasslands than in forests. This is the first study to estimate the effect of different soil fauna groups on litter consumption and related processes at global scale.},

	abstract = {Soil fauna consumes substantial amounts of litter and can even consume the entire annual litterfall in some ecosystems. The assimilation efficiency of fauna may reach 50\% but is usually much smaller. Soil fauna may affect soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics not only by assimilating litter but also by modifying the soil environment at many spatiotemporal scales. Litter processing by fauna usually results in a short-term increase in microbial activity in feces; this activity than decreases such that feces over the long term may decompose more slowly than the original litter. During passage through the guts of litter-feeding fauna, litter modifications include fragmentation, consumption of associated microorganisms, pH and redox changes, removal of easily decomposed polysaccharides, increase in the proportion of lignin, and decrease in soluble polyphenols and carbon:nitrogen (C:N) ratios. The coating of litter with clay during passage through earthworms reduces microbial access to the litter as well as conditions for microbial activity by reducing the diffusion of nutrients and oxygen. At a larger scale, soil fauna affects leaching and the release of particulate organic matter (POM), which in turn affect microbial activity in soil. Fauna also affects the distribution of organic matter in the soil profile and determine whether litter decomposes on the soil surface or as POM bound to soil particles, which substantially affects the microbial community and the rate of decomposition. Fauna affects the amount of organic matter entering different SOM pools, and this effect depends on litter quality and the degree of soil C saturation. At an even larger scale, fauna can change the soil profile, soil properties, and the plant community, which may in turn affect microbial activity and the decomposition rate. The effect of soil fauna on litter decomposition and soil C storage can be positive or negative. Faunal effects tend to be greatest in ecosystems under transition, e.g. ecosystem developing after some disturbance during primary or secondary succession.},

	abstract = {Aim Macroinvertebrates comprise a highly diverse set of taxa with great potential as indicators of soil quality. Communities were sampled at 3,694 sites distributed world-wide. We aimed to analyse the patterns of abundance, composition and network characteristics and their relationships to latitude, mean annual temperature and rainfall, land cover, soil texture and agricultural practices. Location Sites are distributed in 41 countries, ranging from 55° S to 57° N latitude, from 0 to 4,000 m in elevation, with annual rainfall ranging from 500 to {\textgreater}3,000 mm and mean temperatures of 5–32°C. Time period 1980–2018. Major taxa studied All soil macroinvertebrates: Haplotaxida; Coleoptera; Formicidae; Arachnida; Chilopoda; Diplopoda; Diptera; Isoptera; Isopoda; Homoptera; Hemiptera; Gastropoda; Blattaria; Orthoptera; Lepidoptera; Dermaptera; and “others”. Methods Standard ISO 23611-5 sampling protocol was applied at all sites. Data treatment used a set of multivariate analyses, principal components analysis (PCA) on macrofauna data transformed by Hellinger’s method, multiple correspondence analysis for environmental data (latitude, elevation, temperature and average annual rainfall, type of vegetation cover) transformed into discrete classes, coinertia analysis to compare these two data sets, and bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap tests to evaluate the part of the variance of the macrofauna data attributable to each of the environmental factors. Network analysis was performed. Each pairwise association of taxonomic units was tested against a null model considering local and regional scales, in order to avoid spurious correlations. Results Communities were separated into five clusters reflecting their densities and taxonomic richness. They were significantly influenced by climatic conditions, soil texture and vegetation cover. Abundance and diversity, highest in tropical forests (1,895 ± 234 individuals/m2) and savannahs (1,796 ± 72 individuals/m2), progressively decreased in tropical cropping systems (tree-associated crops, 1,358 ± 120 individuals/m2; pastures, 1,178 ± 154 individuals/m2; and annual crops, 867 ± 62 individuals/m2), temperate grasslands (529 ± 60 individuals/m2), forests (232 ± 20 individuals/m2) and annual crops (231 ± 24 individuals/m2) and temperate dry forests and shrubs (195 ± 11 individuals/m2). Agricultural management decreased overall abundance by ≤54\% in tropical areas and 64\% in temperate areas. Connectivity varied with taxa, with dominant positive connections in litter transformers and negative connections with ecosystem engineers and Arachnida. Connectivity and modularity were higher in communities with low abundance and taxonomic richness. Main conclusions Soil macroinvertebrate communities respond to climatic, soil and land-cover conditions. All taxa, except termites, are found everywhere, and communities from the five clusters cover a wide range of geographical and environmental conditions. Agricultural practices significantly decrease abundance, although the presence of tree components alleviates this effect.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT Effects of border cell and root tip exudates on root knot nematode (Meloidogyne incognita) behavior were examined. In whole-plant assays using pea, M. incognita second-stage juveniles (J2) accumulated rapidly around the 1- to 2-mm apical region ensheathed by border cells, but not in the region of elongation. Within 15 to 30 min, J2 which had accumulated within detached clumps of border cells lost motility and entered into a quiescent state. When border cells (and associated root tip exudates) were washed from pea roots prior to challenge with nematodes, no such accumulation and quiescence was induced. Attraction of nematodes by roots was species dependent: no attraction or accumulation occurred in snap bean. Using a quantitative assay, three categories of chemotaxis responses occurred: attraction (pea and alfalfa cv. Thor), repulsion (alfalfa cv. Moapa 69), and no response (snap bean and alfalfa cv. Lahonton). In contrast, total root tip exudates from all three plant species acted as a repellent for M. incognita in the sand assay. An in vitro assay was developed to characterize the induced quiescence response. When total root tip exudate from the tested legumes (as well as corn) was incubated with J2 populations, {\textgreater}80\% of the nematodes lost motility. A similar response occurred in Caenorhabditis elegans. Border cell exudates did not induce or contribute to the induction of quiescence. Cocultivation of pea border cells with M. incognita resulted in changes in border cell shape similar to those observed in response to exogenous plant hormones. No such changes occurred in snap bean border cells. Understanding the cell- and host-specific extracellular recognition that occurs between roots and pathogenic nematodes in the early stages before infection occurs could lead to new avenues for disease control.},

At all locations the ability of S. sisymbriifolium to reduce Globodera encysted second-stage juveniles (J2) in egg densities compared to fallow was considered.

Encysted J2 in egg densities of all three Globodera spp. declined from 25 to 68\% after trap cropping with S. sisymbriifolium. For G. pallida, S. sisymbriifolium reduced final encysted J2 in egg density by 23 to 50\% compared to the fallow treatment, and significantly decreased G. pallida reproduction on potato after exposure to S. sisymbriifolium by 99 to 100\% compared to the fallow treatment (P {\textless} 0.0001). For G. ellingtonae, the planting date of S. sisymbriifolium in May or June did not impact final egg densities (P = 0.32). Rather, percentage reduction in G. ellingtonae encysted J2 in egg density was most influenced by the length of time to which nematodes were exposed to S. sisymbriifolium, with 30 and 81\% reduction after 6 vs 12 wk of exposure, respectively (P {\textless} 0.0001). Similar levels of nematode reduction after S. sisymbriifolium were observed for G. tabacum after 12 to 14 wk of exposure to the trap crop; G. tabacum density changes consisted of a 114\% increase after susceptible tobacco, a 65\% decrease after resistant tobacco, and an 88\% decrease after S. sisymbriifolium compared to bare soil.

	abstract = {Globodera pallida, the pale cyst nematode, is a quarantined potato pest first found in Idaho in 2006. The containment and eradication of this economically devastating pest has been the focus of control since its discovery. Globodera pallida survives for 30+ years in soil and can cause up to 80\% yield loss in susceptible potato varieties. Soil fumigants have been key to eradication efforts but many have been banned. Therefore, new control methods are needed. Solanum sisymbriifolium induces hatching but limits G. pallida reproduction and can be used as an alternative control measure. However, as S. sisymbriifolium has little economic value as a crop and its seeds are largely unavailable, it has not been widely adopted by potato producers. There is evidence that this plant kills the nematode by producing toxins, although this is poorly understood. Liquid-liquid extraction of S. sisymbriifolium leaf and stem tissues by hexane and 1-butanol reduced hatch by 49.5\%, and 68.3\%, respectively, compared with the potato root diffusate control. Many chemicals may be responsible for this toxic effect, including steroidal glycoalkaloids produced by plants in the Solanaceae family. The discovery of novel chemistries for nematicide development would be valuable for potato cyst nematode control.},

Process bundles are arranged longitudinally and circumferentially and are often adjacent to ridges of hypodermis. Neurons are generally highly locally connected, making synaptic connections with many of their neighbours. Muscle cells have arms that run out to process bundles containing motoneuron axons. Here they receive their synaptic input in defined regions along the surface of the bundles, where motoneuron axons reside. Most of the morphologically identifiable synaptic connections in a typical animal are described. These consist of about 5000 chemical synapses, 2000 neuromuscular junctions and 600 gap junctions.},

The humble organism he chose, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, is now one of the most thoroughly characterized metazoans, particularly in terms of its nervous system. One of Brenner’s motivations in adapting C. elegans as a model organism was to understand the totality of the molecular and cellular basis for the control of animal behavior (Brener 1988). In this chapter, we review what is arguably the best-studied aspect of C. elegans behavior: response to chemical stimuli. The C. elegans neurobiology literature can be intimidating for the uninitiated; we attempt to limit the use of “worm jargon” in this review. For a more C. elegans-centric review, we refer you to other excellent sources (Bargmann 2006).},

Chemotaxis to volatile odorants requires different sensory neurons from chemotaxis to water-soluble attractants, indicating that C. elegans might have senses that correspond to smell and taste, respectively. Single neurons have complex sensory properties, since six distinguishable volatile odorants are sensed by only two types of sensory neurons.

	abstract = {Microorganisms and nematodes in the rhizosphere profoundly impact plant health, and small-molecule signaling is presumed to play a central role in plant rhizosphere interactions. However, the nature of the signals and underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we show that the ascaroside ascr\#18, a pheromone secreted by plant-parasitic nematodes, is metabolized by plants to generate chemical signals that repel nematodes and reduce infection. Comparative metabolomics of plant tissues and excretions revealed that ascr\#18 is converted into shorter side-chained ascarosides that confer repellency. An Arabidopsis mutant defective in two peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidases does not metabolize ascr\#18 and does not repel nematodes, indicating that plants, like nematodes, employ conserved peroxisomal β-oxidation to edit ascarosides and change their message. Our results suggest that plant-editing of nematode pheromones serves as a defense mechanism that acts in parallel to conventional pattern-triggered immunity, demonstrating that plants may actively manipulate chemical signaling of soil organisms.},

	abstract = {Plant-defense responses are triggered by perception of conserved microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs), for example, flagellin or peptidoglycan. However, it remained unknown whether plants can detect conserved molecular patterns derived from plant-parasitic animals, including nematodes. Here we show that several genera of plant-parasitic nematodes produce small molecules called ascarosides, an evolutionarily conserved family of nematode pheromones. Picomolar to micromolar concentrations of ascr\#18, the major ascaroside in plant-parasitic nematodes, induce hallmark defense responses including the expression of genes associated with MAMP-triggered immunity, activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases, as well as salicylic acid- and jasmonic acid-mediated defense signalling pathways. Ascr\#18 perception increases resistance in Arabidopsis, tomato, potato and barley to viral, bacterial, oomycete, fungal and nematode infections. These results indicate that plants recognize ascarosides as a conserved molecular signature of nematodes. Using small-molecule signals such as ascarosides to activate plant immune responses has potential utility to improve economic and environmental sustainability of agriculture.},

Here we show that the dauer pheromone consists of several structurally related ascarosides—derivatives of the dideoxysugar ascarylose—and that two of these ascarosides (1 and 2) are roughly two orders of magnitude more potent at inducing dauer formation than a previously reported dauer pheromone component (3) and constitute a physiologically relevant signal. The identification of dauer pheromone components 1 and 2 will facilitate the identification of target receptors and downstream signaling proteins.},

	abstract = {Small molecule metabolites play important roles in Caenorhabditis elegans biology, but effective approaches for identifying their chemical structures are lacking. Recent studies revealed that a family of glycosides, the ascarosides, differentially regulate C. elegans development and behavior. Low concentrations of ascarosides attract males and thus appear to be part of the C. elegans sex pheromone, whereas higher concentrations induce developmental arrest at the dauer stage, an alternative, nonaging larval stage. The ascarosides act synergistically, which presented challenges for their identification via traditional activity-guided fractionation. As a result the chemical characterization of the dauer and male attracting pheromones remained incomplete. Here, we describe the identification of several additional pheromone components by using a recently developed NMR-spectroscopic approach, differential analysis by 2D NMR spectroscopy (DANS), which simplifies linking small molecule metabolites with their biological function. DANS-based comparison of wild-type C. elegans and a signaling-deficient mutant, daf-22, enabled identification of 3 known and 4 previously undescribed ascarosides, including a compound that features a p-aminobenzoic acid subunit. Biological testing of synthetic samples of these compounds revealed additional evidence for synergy and provided insights into structure–activity relationships. Using a combination of the three most active ascarosides allowed full reconstitution of the male-attracting activity of wild-type pheromone extract. Our results highlight the efficacy of DANS as a method for identifying small-molecule metabolites and placing them within a specific genetic context. This study further supports the hypothesis that ascarosides represent a structurally diverse set of nematode signaling molecules regulating major life history traits.},

It has been proposed that these volatile signals can be manipulated to improve crop protection. Here, we demonstrate the full potential of this strategy by restoring the emission of a specific belowground signal emitted by insect-damaged maize roots. The western corn rootworm induces the roots of many maize varieties to emit (E)-beta-caryophyllene, which attracts entomopathogenic nematodes that infect and kill the voracious root pest. However, most North American maize varieties have lost the ability to emit (E)-beta-caryophyllene and may therefore receive little protection from the nematodes. To restore the signal, a nonemitting maize line was transformed with a (E)-beta-caryophyllene synthase gene from oregano, resulting in constitutive emissions of this sesquiterpene. In rootworm-infested field plots in which nematodes were released, the (E)-beta-caryophyllene-emitting plants suffered significantly less root damage and had 60\% fewer adult beetles emerge than untransformed, nonemitting lines. This demonstration that plant volatile emissions can be manipulated to enhance the effectiveness of biological control agents opens the way for novel and ecologically sound strategies to fight a variety of insect pests.},

	abstract = {A recent boom in research on belowground ecology is rapidly revealing a multitude of fascinating interactions, in particular in the rhizosphere. Many of these interactions are mediated by photo-assimilates that are excreted by plant roots. Root exudates are not mere waste products, but serve numerous functions to control abiotic and biotic processes. These functions range from changing the chemical and physical properties of the soil, inhibiting the growth of competing plants, combatting herbivores, and regulating the microbial community. Particularly intriguing are root-released compounds that have evolved to serve mutualistic interactions with soil-dwelling organisms. These mutually beneficial plant-mediated signals are not only of fundamental ecological interest, but also exceedingly important from an agronomical perspective. Here, we attempt to provide an overview of the plant-produced compounds that have so far been implicated in mutualistic interactions. We propose that these mutualistic signals may have evolved from chemical defenses and we point out that they can be (mis)used by specialized pathogens and herbivores. We speculate that many more signals and interactions remain to be uncovered and that a good understanding of the mechanisms and ecological implications can be the basis for exploitation and manipulation of the signals for crop improvement and protection.},

	abstract = {When larvae of rootworms feed on maize roots they induce the emission of the sesquiterpene (E)-β-caryophyllene (EβC). EβC is attractive to entomopathogenic nematodes, which parasitize and rapidly kill the larvae, thereby protecting the roots from further damage. Certain root-colonizing bacteria of the genus Pseudomonas also benefit plants by promoting growth, suppressing pathogens or inducing systemic resistance (ISR), and some strains also have insecticidal activity. It remains unknown how these bacteria influence the emissions of root volatiles. In this study, we evaluated how colonization by the growth-promoting and insecticidal bacteria Pseudomonas protegens CHA0 and Pseudomonas chlororaphis PCL1391 affects the production of EβC upon feeding by larvae of the banded cucumber beetle, Diabrotica balteata Le Conte (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae). Using chemical analysis and gene expression measurements, we found that EβC production and the expression of the EβC synthase gene (tps23) were enhanced in Pseudomonas protegens CHA0-colonized roots after 72 h of D. balteata feeding. Undamaged roots colonized by Pseudomonas spp. showed no measurable increase in EβC production, but a slight increase in tps23 expression. Pseudomonas colonization did not affect root biomass, but larvae that fed on roots colonized by P. protegens CHA0 tended to gain more weight than larvae that fed on roots colonized by P. chlororaphis PCL1391. Larvae mortality on Pseudomonas spp. colonized roots was slightly, but not significantly higher than on non-colonized control roots. The observed enhanced production of EβC upon Pseudomonas protegens CHA0 colonization may enhance the roots' attractiveness to entomopathogenic nematodes, but this remains to be tested.},

	abstract = {Three environmental cues influence both the entry into and exit from the developmentally arrested dispersal stage called the dauer larva: a dauer-inducing pheromone, food, and temperature. The pheromone, which is a measure of population density, induces dauer larva formation at the second (L2) molt and inhibits recovery in a dose-dependent manner. Food acts competitively to reduce the frequency of dauer larva formation and to enhance recovery. The pheromone causes a specific extension of the second larval stage, coupled with a transient decrease in the growth rate of the L2. Second-stage larvae grown in the presence of added pheromone are morphologically distinguishable from L2 larvae grown without pheromone. We have named the pre-dauer L2 larva the L2d. Commitment to dauer larva formation can occur at the L2d molt. When L2d larvae are shifted out of pheromone to a lawn of E. coli just before the L2d molt, a few worms complete development into dauer larvae. In contrast, worms are essentially committed to the non-dauer life cycle by the first larval molt if the L1 larvae are not grown in appropriately high levels of pheromone. In the presence of pheromone, the percentage of dauer larva formation is enhanced at higher temperatures within the normal growth range. Temperature down-shifts induce dauer larva recovery. Temperature-shift experiments show that the enhancement of dauer larva formation requires exposure to the higher temperature around the L1 molt. Two sensory mutants defective in thermotaxis are altered in their sensitivity to the dauer-inducing pheromone, but their pheromone response retains temperature dependence. Response of dauer larvae to environmental cues is highly age dependent, with older dauer larvae exhibiting an increased tendency to recover.},

We have demonstrated that adult C. elegans display an acute avoidance response upon exposure to CO2 that is characterized by the cessation of forward movement and the rapid initiation of backward movement. This response is mediated by a cGMP signaling pathway that includes the cGMP-gated heteromeric channel TAX-2/TAX-4. CO2 avoidance is modulated by multiple signaling molecules, including the neuropeptide Y receptor NPR-1 and the calcineurin subunits TAX-6 and CNB-1. Nutritional status also modulates CO2 responsiveness via the insulin and TGFβ signaling pathways. CO2 response is mediated by a neural circuit that includes the BAG neurons, a pair of sensory neurons of previously unknown function. TAX-2/TAX-4 function in the BAG neurons to mediate acute CO2 avoidance.

	abstract = {Homeostasis of internal carbon dioxide (CO2) and oxygen (O2) levels is fundamental to all animals. Here we examine the CO2 response of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. This species inhabits rotting material, which typically has a broad CO2 concentration range. We show that well fed C. elegans avoid CO2 levels above 0.5\%. Animals can respond to both absolute CO2 concentrations and changes in CO2 levels within seconds. Responses to CO2 do not reflect avoidance of acid pH but appear to define a new sensory response. Sensation of CO2 is promoted by the cGMP-gated ion channel subunits TAX-2 and TAX-4, but other pathways are also important. Robust CO2 avoidance in well fed animals requires inhibition of the DAF-16 forkhead transcription factor by the insulin-like receptor DAF-2. Starvation, which activates DAF-16, strongly suppresses CO2 avoidance. Exposure to hypoxia ({\textless}1\% O2) also suppresses CO2 avoidance via activation of the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF-1. The npr-1 215V allele of the naturally polymorphic neuropeptide receptor npr-1, besides inhibiting avoidance of high ambient O2 in feeding C. elegans, also promotes avoidance of high CO2. C. elegans integrates competing O2 and CO2 sensory inputs so that one response dominates. Food and allelic variation at NPR-1 regulate which response prevails. Our results suggest that multiple sensory inputs are coordinated by C. elegans to generate different coherent foraging strategies.},

	abstract = {Nematode-trapping fungi (NTF) are a group of specialized microbial predators that consume nematodes when food sources are limited. Predation is initiated when conserved nematode ascaroside pheromones are sensed, followed by the development of complex trapping devices. To gain insights into the coevolution of this interkingdom predator-prey relationship, we investigated natural populations of nematodes and NTF that we found to be ubiquitous in soils. Arthrobotrys species were sympatric with various nematode species and behaved as generalist predators. The ability to sense prey among wild isolates of Arthrobotrys oligospora varied greatly, as determined by the number of traps after exposure to Caenorhabditis elegans While some strains were highly sensitive to C. elegans and the nematode pheromone ascarosides, others responded only weakly. Furthermore, strains that were highly sensitive to the nematode prey also developed traps faster. The polymorphic nature of trap formation correlated with competency in prey killing, as well as with the phylogeny of A. oligospora natural strains, calculated after assembly and annotation of the genomes of 20 isolates. A chromosome-level genome assembly and annotation were established for one of the most sensitive wild isolates, and deletion of the only G-protein β-subunit-encoding gene of A. oligospora nearly abolished trap formation. In summary, our study establishes a highly responsive A. oligospora wild isolate as a model strain for the study of fungus-nematode interactions and demonstrates that trap formation is a fitness character in generalist predators of the nematode-trapping fungus family.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nematodes are among the most successful animals on earth and include important human pathogens, yet little is known about nematode pheromone systems. A group of small molecules called ascarosides has been found to mediate mate finding, aggregation, and developmental diapause in Caenorhabditis elegans, but it is unknown whether ascaroside signaling exists outside of the genus Caenorhabditis.
RESULTS: To determine whether ascarosides are used as signaling molecules by other nematode species, we performed a mass spectrometry-based screen for ascarosides in secretions from a variety of both free-living and parasitic (plant, insect, and animal) nematodes. We found that most of the species analyzed, including nematodes from several different clades, produce species-specific ascaroside mixtures. In some cases, ascaroside biosynthesis patterns appear to correlate with phylogeny, whereas in other cases, biosynthesis seems to correlate with lifestyle and ecological niche. We further show that ascarosides mediate distinct nematode behaviors, such as retention, avoidance, and long-range attraction, and that different nematode species respond to distinct, but overlapping, sets of ascarosides.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that nematodes utilize a conserved family of signaling molecules despite having evolved to occupy diverse ecologies. Their structural features and level of conservation are evocative of bacterial quorum sensing, where acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) are both produced and sensed by many species of gram-negative bacteria. The identification of species-specific ascaroside profiles may enable pheromone-based approaches to interfere with reproduction and survival of parasitic nematodes, which are responsible for significant agricultural losses and many human diseases worldwide.},

Traps are not only the weapons that NTF use to capture and infect nematodes, but also an important indicator of their switch from a saprophytic to a predacious lifestyle. Formation of traps and their numbers are closely related to the nematicidal activity of NTF, so the mechanisms governing trap formation have become a focus of research on NTF. Recently, much progress has been made in our understanding of trap formation, evolution, and the genome, proteome and transcriptome of NTF. Here we provide a comprehensive overview of recent advances in research on traps of NTF. Various inducers of trap formation, trap development, structural properties and evolution of traps are summarized and discussed.

Conidia of Arthrobotrys oligospora produced a few mycelial traps (MT) and conidial traps (CT) when cultured with bacterial cells that they did not produce when cultured with a bacterial cell-free culture filtrate. However, co-culture of A. oligospora with bacterial cells and bacteria-free filtrate simultaneously induced MT and CT in large amounts. With the increased concentration of bacteria-free filtrate, the number of typical CT increased, but conidial germination was progressively inhibited. Scanning electron microscopy of A. oligospora co-cultured with bacteria revealed that bacterial attachment to hyphae was a prerequisite to trap formation and that bacteria-free filtrate facilitated bacterial attachments to hyphae. The results that the addition of nutrients in co-culture medium decreased the number of traps suggest that this type of trap formation may be favoured at a low nutrient status. Eight fungi tested were able to form MT and CT when co-cultured with bacterial cells and bacteria-free culture filtrate, but the abilities varied among species. This study provides novel evidence that under laboratory conditions, soil bacteria attaching to hyphae could induce traps in nematode-trapping fungi.},

	abstract = {Nematode-trapping fungi live mainly as saprobes in soil environments. When encountering nematodes, these fungi become 'carnivorous' and develop specialized trapping devices to attack their hosts for extracting nutrients, especially nitrogen source. Thus, nematode-trapping fungi are model organisms for understanding the molecular mechanism of the switch between saprobic and parasitic phases of pathogen life cycles. Arthrobotrys oligospora, one of the best-studied nematode-trapping fungi, mainly lives as a saprobe. In the presence of nematodes, A.oligospora enters the parasitic stage by forming adhesive reticulate traps to capture nematodes. In filamentous fungi, autophagy has been shown to be involved in morphogenesis and morphology. In this study, we demonstrate that autophagy is induced by nematodes during the early stage of trap formation in A.oligospora. Disruption of atg8 gene not only abolishes the nematode-induced autophagy, but also suppresses trap formation and reduces pathogenicity for nematodes. During the early stage of trap formation, the expression of genes involved in amino acid biosynthesis is upregulated and the transcriptional activity of GCN4 is induced in A.oligospora, suggesting that nematodes induce autophagy probably by triggering intracellular amino acid starvation. Autophagy is thus crucial for trap formation in A.oligospora during infection of nematodes.},

Arthrobotrys oligospora is a representative species of NT fungi. Here, we performed a time course transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of transcriptomes to understand the global gene expression levels of A. oligospora during trap formation and predation. We identified 5,752 unique differentially expressed genes, among which the rac gene was significantly upregulated. Alternative splicing events occurred in 2,012 genes, including the rac and rho2 gene. Furthermore, we characterized three Rho GTPases (Rho2, Rac, and Cdc42) in A. oligospora using gene disruption and multiphenotypic analysis. Our analyses showed that AoRac and AoCdc42 play an important role in mycelium growth, lipid accumulation, DNA damage, sporulation, trap formation, pathogenicity, and stress response in A. oligospora. AoCdc42 and AoRac specifically interacted with components of the Nox complex, thus regulating the production of reactive oxygen species. Moreover, the transcript levels of several genes associated with protein kinase A, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and p21-activated kinase were also altered in the mutants, suggesting that Rho GTPases might function upstream from these kinases. This study highlights the important role of Rho GTPases in A. oligospora and provides insights into the regulatory mechanisms of signaling pathways in the trap morphogenesis and lifestyle transition of NT fungi. IMPORTANCE Nematode-trapping (NT) fungi are widely distributed in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Their broad adaptability and flexible lifestyles make them ideal agents for controlling pathogenic nematodes. Arthrobotrys oligospora is a model species employed for understanding the interaction between fungi and nematodes. Here, we revealed that alternative splicing events play a crucial role in the trap development and lifestyle transition in A. oligospora. Furthermore, Rho GTPases exert differential effects on the growth, development, and pathogenicity of A. oligospora. In particular, AoRac is required for sporulation and trap morphogenesis. In addition, our analysis showed that Rho GTPases regulate the production of reactive oxygen species and function upstream from several kinases. Collectively, these results expand our understanding of gene expression and alternative splicing events in A. oligospora and the important roles of Rho GTPases in NT fungi, thereby providing a foundation for exploring their potential application in the biocontrol of pathogenic nematodes.},

Arthrobotrys oligospora is a representative nematode-trapping fungus that can produce adhesive networks to capture nematodes. In this study, the roles of two Rab GTPases AoRab-7A and AoRab-2 were characterized by gene knockout in the fungus A. oligospora. The disruption of AoRab-7A hindered the mycelial growth in different media, the conidiation of ΔAoRab-7A transformants was almost abolished, and the transcription of four sporulation-related genes (AbaA, FluG, Hyp1, and VosA) was downregulated compared to the wild-type strain (WT). Furthermore, the tolerance of the ΔAoRab-7A mutants to sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and H2O2 was also significantly reduced compared to the WT, and the transcription of several genes related to environmental resistance, such as genes for catalase and trehalose synthase, was downregulated. Similarly, the extracellular proteolytic activity was decreased. Importantly, the ΔAoRab-7A mutants were unable to produce traps and capture nematodes. However, the disruption of gene AoRab-2 only affected the conidiation slightly but non-significantly, while other phenotypic traits were unaffected. Moreover, the gene AoRab-7A was also involved in the autophagy induced by nitrogen deprivation in A. oligospora.

Under low-nutrient conditions, Arthrobotrys oligospora and other nematode-trapping fungi develop dedicated structures for nematode capture when exposed to nematode-derived cues, including a conserved family of pheromones, the ascarosides. A. oligospora senses ascarosides via conserved MAPK and cAMP–PKA pathways; however, the upstream receptors remain unknown. Here, using genomic, transcriptomic and functional analyses, we identified two families of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) involved in sensing distinct nematode-derived cues. GPCRs homologous to yeast glucose receptors are required for ascaroside sensing, whereas Pth11-like GPCRs contribute to ascaroside-independent nematode sensing. Both GPCR classes activate conserved cAMP–PKA signalling to trigger trap development. This work demonstrates that predatory fungi use multiple GPCRs to sense several distinct nematode-derived cues for prey recognition and to enable a switch to a predatory lifestyle. Identification of these receptors reveals the molecular mechanisms of cross-kingdom communication via conserved pheromones also sensed by plants and animals.},

Treatment of Caenorhabditis elegans with 3-octanone recapitulates the rapid paralysis, calcium influx, and neuronal cell death arising from fungal contact. Moreover, 3-octanone disrupts cell membrane integrity, resulting in extracellular calcium influx into cytosol and mitochondria, propagating cell death throughout the entire organism. Last, we demonstrate that structurally related compounds are also biotoxic to C. elegans, with the length of the ketone carbon chain being crucial. Our work reveals that the oyster mushroom has evolved a specialized structure containing a volatile ketone to disrupt the cell membrane integrity of its prey, leading to rapid cell and organismal death in nematodes.},

This study investigated toxocyst development using a strain S396 of Pleurotus cystidiosus subsp. abalonus (subgen. Coremiopleurotus). The surface of the liquid droplet was found to be an elastic envelope. When a nematode touches the toxocyst, the envelope adheres to the worm and bursts. Toxocysts are induced simultaneously with coremia formation in the absence of nematodes and developed only from aerial hyphae in which nuclear division had ceased. In the early stage of toxocyst development, liquid springs repeatedly from the tip of the sterigma-like stipe before ovoid (blastoconidium-like structure) formation. A certain substance in the liquid might polymerize to form the envelope while the ovoid simultaneously budded in the droplet. The nucleus tends to locate near the toxocyst, especially in early stage of toxocyst development. Each dikaryotic cell predominantly formed one or two toxocyst(s) while each monokaryotic cell predominantly formed one. In rare cases, a nucleus existed in the toxocyst, suggesting the possibility that the toxocyst is a vestigial blastoconidium.},

	abstract = {Predatory fungi attack nematodes and other microorganisms using a remarkable array of trapping devices to attract, capture, kill, and digest nematodes for food. The novelty of these relationships, however, has deflected attention from a more fundamental role played by these fungi in the ecosystem. The primary function of predatory fungi appears to be that of wood decay and hence they are cellulolytic or ligno-cellulolytic fungi\_that attack other organisms as sources of nitrogen to supplement a primarily carbohydrate (woody) diet. The Carbon to Nitrogen ratio (C:N) of wood is extremely high and nitrogen is the limiting factor for growth of predatory fungi. Predation of nematodes or other organisms adds extra protein (nitrogen) to the system and reduces the C:N to manageable proportions. More importantly, nematode predation, although dramatic, is perhaps of less importance than the ability of wood decay fungi to attack bacteria and perhaps other life forms as nutrient supplements. By definition, therefore, many (most?) wood decay fungi are not saprobes (i.e. living on dead organic material) but are facultative parasites (saprobes that can also parasitize living organisms) for part of their life in which the predatory ‘parasitic’ phase runs parallel to the ‘saprophytic’ wood decay phase and both are essential to success. Based on their roles in building up woody material through mycorrhizal associations, and destroying it through biological decay, it is not surprising that the biomass of fungi in forest soils reaches 90\% of the total and exceeds all other micro and meso-organisms combined. Based on the respiration of their massive amounts of hyphal material, fungi are the driving force in the biological component of the terrestrial carbon cycle.},

They exhibit a wide continuum of variation in their reproductive strategies, ranging from amphimixis to obligatory mitotic parthenogenesis. Molecular phylogenetic studies have highlighted divergence between mitotic and meiotic parthenogenetic RKN species and probable interspecific hybridization as critical steps in their speciation and diversification process. The recent completion of the genomes of two RKNs, Meloidogyne hapla and Meloidogyne incognita, that exhibit striking differences in their mode of reproduction (with and without sex, respectively), their geographic distribution, and their host range has opened the way for deciphering the evolutionary significance of (a)sexual reproduction in these parasites. Accumulating evidence suggests that whole-genome duplication (in M. incognita) and horizontal gene transfers (HGTs) represent major forces that have shaped the genome of current RKN species and may account for the extreme adaptive capacities and parasitic success of these nematodes.},

The ancestors, age, and origins of the polyphagous RKN are obscure, but there is increasing evidence that M. incognita, M. javanica, and M. arenaria are closely related, heterogeneous species with a recent, hybrid (reticulate) origin. If so, they must owe much of their current worldwide distributions to spread by agriculture. Host resistance appears to be generally durable in the field, but laboratory studies suggest that apomixis does not prevent evolution in response to selection by a parasitic bacterium (Pasteuria penetrans) and host resistance. Maintaining general fitness may be the evolutionary priority for most populations of polyphagous RKN, and a wide host range, important in the field but not in the laboratory, may be conserved by apomixis. Several factors may help confer a wide host range, including suppression of host resistance, perhaps as a consequence of the strength of the induced susceptible response. Resistance genes effective against RKN appear not to have resulted from coevolution. Rates of juvenile invasion and/or development are low in many wild and some crop plants, with the result that they are both poor hosts and sustain less damage.

NETs have been shown to play a role in immune response to bacteria, fungi, viruses, and protozoan parasites. Mutation of genes encoding group A Streptococcus extracellular DNases (exDNases) results in reduced virulence in animals, a finding that implies that exDNases are deployed as counter defense against host DNA-containing NETs. Is the exDNA/exDNase mechanism also relevant to plants and their pathogens? It has been demonstrated previously that exDNA is a component of a matrix secreted from plant root caps and that plants also carry out an extracellular trapping process. Treatment with DNase I destroys root tip resistance to infection by fungi, the most abundant plant pathogens. We show that the absence of a single gene encoding a candidate exDNase results in significantly reduced virulence of a fungal plant pathogen to its host on leaves, the known infection site, and on roots. Mg2+-dependent exDNase activity was demonstrated in fungal culture filtrates and induced when host leaf material was present. It is speculated that the enzyme functions to degrade plant-secreted DNA, a component of a complex matrix akin to neutrophil extracellular traps of animals.IMPORTANCE We document that the absence of a single gene encoding a DNase in a fungal plant pathogen results in significantly reduced virulence to a plant host. We compared a wild-type strain of the maize pathogen Cochliobolus heterostrophus and an isogenic mutant lacking a candidate secreted DNase-encoding gene and demonstrated that the mutant is reduced in virulence on leaves and on roots. There are no previous reports of deletion of such a gene from either an animal or plant fungal pathogen accompanied by comparative assays of mutants and wild type for alterations in virulence. We observed DNase activity, in fungal culture filtrates, that is Mg2+ dependent and induced when plant host leaf material is present. Our findings demonstrate not only that fungi use extracellular DNases (exDNases) for virulence, but also that the relevant molecules are deployed in above-ground leaves as well as below-ground plant tissues. Overall, these data provide support for a common defense/counter defense virulence mechanism used by animals, plants, and their fungal and bacterial pathogens and suggest that components of the mechanism might be novel targets for the control of plant disease.},

In plants, adding DNase I to root tips eliminates border cell extracellular traps and abolishes root tip resistance to infection.

	abstract = {This review discusses how extracellular DNA (exDNA) might function in plant defense, and at what level(s) of innate immunity this process might operate. A new role for extracellular factors in mammalian defense has been described in a series of studies. These studies reveal that cells including neutrophils, eosinophils, and mast cells produce ‘extracellular traps’ (ETs) consisting of histone-linked exDNA. When pathogens are attracted to such ETs, they are trapped and killed. When the exDNA component of ETs is degraded, trapping is impaired and resistance against invasion is reduced. Conversely, mutation of microbial genes encoding exDNases that degrade exDNA results in loss of virulence. This discovery that exDNases are virulence factors opens new avenues for disease control. In plants, exDNA is required for defense of the root tip. Innate immunity-related proteins are among a group of {\textgreater}100 proteins secreted from the root cap and root border cell populations. Direct tests revealed that exDNA also is rapidly synthesized and exported from the root tip. When this exDNA is degraded by the endonuclease DNase 1, root tip resistance to fungal infection is lost; when the polymeric structure is degraded more slowly, by the exonuclease BAL31, loss of resistance to fungal infection is delayed accordingly. The results suggest that root border cells may function in a manner analogous to that which occurs in mammalian cells.},

The list has been compiled from some 270 published papers, including analyses of 991 species of flowering plants and a few gymnosperms, a sample including seed plants from 90 families and 38 orders. The compounds belong to seven major compound classes, of which the aliphatics, the benzenoids and phenylpropanoids, and, among the terpenes, the mono- and sesquiterpenes, occur in most orders of seeds plants. C5-branched compounds, irregular terpenes, nitrogen-containing compounds, and a class of miscellaneous cyclic compounds have been recorded in about two-thirds of the orders. Sulfur-containing compounds occur in a third of the orders, whereas diterpenes have been reported from three orders only. The most common single compounds in floral scent are the monoterpenes limonene, (E)-β-ocimene, myrcene, linalool, α- and β-pinene, and the benzenoids benzaldehyde, methyl 2-hydroxybenzoate (methyl salicylate), benzyl alcohol, and 2-phenyl ethanol, which occur in 54–71\% of the families investigated so far. The sesquiterpene caryophyllene and the irregular terpene 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one are also common and occur in more than 50\% of the families. Orchidaceae are by far the best investigated family, followed by several families known to have many species with strongly scented flowers, such as Araceae, Arecaceae, Magnoliaceae, and Rosaceae. However, the majority of angiosperm families are still poorly investigated. Relationships between floral scent and pollination, chemistry, evolution, and phylogeny are briefly discussed. It is concluded that floral scent chemistry is of little use for phylogenetic estimates above the genus level, whereas the distribution and combinations of floral scent compounds at species and subspecific levels is a promising field of investigation for the understanding of adaptations and evolutionary processes in angiosperms.},

Interactions between plant roots and soil microorganisms are critical for plant fitness in natural environments. Given this co-evolution and the pivotal importance of plant-microbial interactions, it has been hypothesized, and a growing body of literature suggests, that plants may regulate the composition of their rhizosphere to promote the growth of microorganisms that improve plant fitness in a given ecosystem. Here, using a combination of comparative genomics and exometabolomics, we show that pre-programmed developmental processes in plants (Avena barbata) result in consistent patterns in the chemical composition of root exudates. This chemical succession in the rhizosphere interacts with microbial metabolite substrate preferences that are predictable from genome sequences. Specifically, we observed a preference by rhizosphere bacteria for consumption of aromatic organic acids exuded by plants (nicotinic, shikimic, salicylic, cinnamic and indole-3-acetic). The combination of these plant exudation traits and microbial substrate uptake traits interact to yield the patterns of microbial community assembly observed in the rhizosphere of an annual grass. This discovery provides a mechanistic underpinning for the process of rhizosphere microbial community assembly and provides an attractive direction for the manipulation of the rhizosphere microbiome for beneficial outcomes.},

The establishment of specialized FCs requires these effectors to modulate many aspects of plant cell morphogenesis and physiology, including defense responses.

NETs are abundant in vivo in experimental dysentery and spontaneous human appendicitis, two examples of acute inflammation. NETs appear to be a form of innate response that binds microorganisms, prevents them from spreading, and ensures a high local concentration of antimicrobial agents to degrade virulence factors and kill bacteria.},

	abstract = {Many pathogenic bacteria produce extracellular DNase, but the benefit of this enzymatic activity is not understood. For example, all strains of the human bacterial pathogen group A Streptococcus (GAS) produce at least one extracellular DNase, and most strains make several distinct enzymes. Despite six decades of study, it is not known whether production of DNase by GAS enhances virulence. To test the hypothesis that extracellular DNase is required for normal progression of GAS infection, we generated seven isogenic mutant strains in which the three chromosomal- and prophage-encoded DNases made by a contemporary serotype M1 GAS strain were inactivated. Compared to the wild-type parental strain, the isogenic triple-mutant strain was significantly less virulent in two mouse models of invasive infection. The triple-mutant strain was cleared from the skin injection site significantly faster than the wild-type strain. Preferential clearance of the mutant strain was related to the differential extracellular killing of the mutant and wild-type strains, possibly through degradation of neutrophil extracellular traps, innate immune structures composed of chromatin and granule proteins. The triple-mutant strain was also significantly compromised in its ability to cause experimental pharyngeal disease in cynomolgus macaques. Comparative analysis of the seven DNase mutant strains strongly suggested that the prophage-encoded SdaD2 enzyme is the major DNase that contributes to virulence in this clone. We conclude that extracellular DNase activity made by GAS contributes to disease progression, thereby resolving a long-standing question in bacterial pathogenesis research.},

Caenorhabditis elegans, a representative nematode, effectively degraded approximately 99.999\% of eARGs (tetM and kan) in 84 h and completely deactivated them within a few hours. Deoxyribonuclease (DNase) II encoded by nuc-1 in the excretory and secretory products of nematodes was the primary mechanism. A neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree indicated the widespread presence of homologs of the NUC-1 protein in other nematodes, such as Caenorhabditis remanei and Caenorhabditis brenneri, whose capabilities of degrading eARGs were then experimentally confirmed. C. elegans remained effective in degrading eARGs under the effects of natural organic matter (5, 10, and 20 mg/L, 5.26–6.22 log degradation), cation (2.0 mM Mg2+ and 2.5 mM Ca2+, 5.02–5.04 log degradation), temperature conditions (1, 20, and 30 °C, 1.21–5.26 log degradation), and in surface water and wastewater samples (4.78 and 3.23 log degradation, respectively). These findings highlight the pervasive but neglected role of nematodes in the natural decay of eARGs and provide novel approaches for antimicrobial resistance mitigation biotechnology by introducing nematodes to wastewater, sludge, and biosolids.},

	abstract = {Deoxyribonuclease (DNase) II, which was discovered more than 50 years ago, is a mammalian endonuclease that functions optimally at acid pH in the absence of divalent cations. Its lysosomal localization and ubiquitous tissue distribution suggested that this enzyme played a role in the degradation of exogenous DNA encountered by phagocytosis, although the relative importance of such a role was unknown. Subsequent investigations also suggested that DNase II was important for DNA fragmentation and degradation during cell death. Within the last few years, our work and that of others has lead to the cloning of various mammalian DNase II genes as well as the identification and characterization of highly homologous genes in the invertebrates Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. Interestingly, studies of the C. elegans DNase II homolog NUC-1 were the first to suggest that DNase II enzymes were fundamentally important in engulfment-mediated DNA degradation, particularly that associated with programmed cell death, due to the presence of persistent apoptotic-cell nuclei within phagocytic cells in nuc-1 mutants. Similarly, mutation of the Drosophila DNase II-like gene was found to result in the accumulation of low-molecular-weight DNA throughout the animals. Homozygous mutation (knockout) of the DNase II gene in mice revealed a much more complex and extensive phenotype including perinatal lethality. The lethality of DNase II-knockout mice is likely the result of multiple developmental defects, the most obvious being a loss of definitive erythropoiesis. Closer examination revealed that a defect in engulfment-mediated DNA degradation is the primary defect in DNase II-null mice. In this review, we have compiled information from studies on DNase II from various organisms to provide a consensus model for the role of DNase II enzymes in DNA degradation.},

The diversity of trapping structures is large and highly dependent on the environment of the fungus. Within one single species, Arthrobotrys oligospora, not only adhesive nets are formed but also so-called conidial traps, hyphal coils around hyphae of other fungi, and appressoria in the rhizosphere of agricultural crops. In this article these structures and the conditions for their development are described. Since the trapping structures influence the survival and the virulence of their producer, it is important that we know more about the molecular background of their development and function. The application of genomics to understand the function and the development of infection structures, therefore, has substantially increased the potential of A. oligospora to become a model system for fungal morphogenesis.},

	abstract = {Temperate grasslands are part of one of the biggest biomes on earth, sustaining high levels of biodiversity and providing multiple ecosystem services. However, the area covered by this open ecosystem is decreasing worldwide, due to several threats like land use change or climate change. Ground-dwelling arthropods are an important group of the community of grassland soil invertebrates, and they play a key role within this ecosystem, while at the same time being sensitive to the changes caused by management practices like grazing, mowing, prescribed fire, etc. Using the Web of Science database, we conducted a systematic review to identify which groups of arthropods are being used as indicators to evaluate the ecological condition of grasslands in temperate regions, and which indices are being measured. As grasslands have been traditionally managed by humans for centuries, their ecological condition is intrinsically linked to the development of different management practices like grazing, mowing or restoration strategies, which usually affect soil and vegetation structure. We found that macro-arthropods were used in a greater number of studies than micro-arthropods (91\% vs 15\%), and within that size group, beetles were the preferred indicator in most of the temperate grassland types (49\% of the studies), followed by spiders and ants. Few studies used grasshoppers to monitor grasslands changes. The indices more frequently assessed were species richness and abundance, and we identified that the response to the different management practices was quite heterogeneous. Restoration and grazing effects were the two factors more frequently evaluated for macro-arthropods, while micro-arthropods (Acari and Collembola) were dominant to assess land use type. Overall, our findings highlight the need to increase the number of studies in some temperate regions, to explore the potential of overlooked groups of arthropods, and to include indices that measure functional diversity or community composition.},

	abstract = {Non-trophic interactions are shaping soil food web structure and functions. Particularly, the action of ecosystem engineers, such as earthworms, are likely to fundamentally impact the abiotic and biotic properties of their environment. The present study aimed to identify the main mechanisms through which earthworms belonging to varying ecological groups – epigeic, endogeic and anecic species – affect soil microarthropods by reviewing the literature on this topic and by performing meta-analyses. Earthworm ecological groups differed considerably in their impacts on microarthropods, whereas effects did not vary significantly between microarthropod taxa at the habitat scale. Inconsistent impacts of epigeic species on soil microarthropods are most likely due to differences in earthworm densities. Effects can thus be positive in the case of moderate densities or negative in the case of high densities and associated distinct changes in the physical structure of the upper soil organic layers. By contrast, impacts of endogeic earthworms appeared to be mainly negative and were primarily due to competition with microarthropods for food resources. Consequently, negative impacts on soil microarthropods intensified with increasing earthworm density and biomass. This interaction between endogeic earthworms and microarthropods is better referred to as amensalism due to the competitive predominance of earthworms. Impacts of anecic earthworm species differed significantly from that of endogeic ones; they were neutral at the habitat scale and positive on the microhabitat scale. Moreover, impacts were independent of earthworm densities due to the quasi-territorial behaviour of anecic earthworms. Positive effects were mainly attributed to the formation of stable microhabitats by anecic species; namely burrows/middens, rich in nutrients and microorganisms. The present study points to the relevance of the non-trophic biotic interactions that drive the composition of belowground food webs by identifying the most essential mechanisms underlying the impacts of animal ecosystem engineers on soil microarthropods. Moreover, as earthworms emerge as important biological invaders, the results of the present study may help to fully appreciate, estimate and model the consequences of this momentous global change phenomenon. Particularly, the spread of exotic epigeic and endogeic earthworm species likely threatens soil microarthropod density, diversity and functions.},

One compound, methyl 3-methyl-2-butenoate (MMB) additionally triggered strong sex- and stage-specific attraction in several Caenorhabditis species. Furthermore, when MMB is present, it interferes with nematode mating, suggesting that MMB might mimic sex pheromone in Caenorhabditis species. Forward genetic screening suggests that multiple receptors are involved in sensing MMB. Response to fungal odors involves the olfactory neuron AWCs. Single-cell RNA-seq revealed the GPCRs expressed in AWC.

	abstract = {In the early 70s, the soil biologist Marcel Bouché classified French earthworms species into defined ecological categories. This classification system was immensely successful and is still widely used to describe earthworm functional groups even outside of Europe. Bouché used morpho-anatomical traits to differentiate three main categories: epigeic, anecic and endogeic. However, the way species are assigned to a category was not explicitly described in Bouché’s work. Thus, some earthworm species can still be assigned to two categories depending on the way researchers interpret Bouché’s description. To solve these issues and avoid unnecessary controversies, we applied PCA and random forest models to the seminal data of Marcel Bouché (earthworm morpho-anatomical traits). Their assignment to Bouché’s three main categories allowed us to statistically redefine the different categories and determine which traits are the most influential. We found that the three main traits were skin pigmentation (from none to black), body length (mean of the minimal and maximal values) and skin coloration (yes or no), followed by 10 other morphological and anatomical traits. We then used this approach to assign a likely category to all of the species studied by Bouché, resulting in a new triangular graph including other categories such as epi-anecic, endo-anecic, epi-endogeic and intermediate. Finally, we calculated the percentage that each species belongs to each main ecological category. This represents a paradigm shift and may change our vision of earthworm communities enabling the computation of the percentage of anecic, endogeic and epigeic species at the community level and thus overcoming the limits and debate about fixed ecological categories for each species.},

While less conspicuous than introduced aboveground organisms, introduced belowground organisms may have similarly strong effects. Here, we synthesize for the first time the impacts of introduced earthworms on plant diversity and community composition in North American forests. We conducted a meta-analysis using a total of 645 observations to quantify mean effect sizes of associations between introduced earthworm communities and plant diversity, cover of plant functional groups, and cover of native and non-native plants. We found that plant diversity significantly declined with increasing richness of introduced earthworm ecological groups. While plant species richness or evenness did not change with earthworm invasion, our results indicate clear changes in plant community composition: cover of graminoids and non-native plant species significantly increased, and cover of native plant species (of all functional groups) tended to decrease, with increasing earthworm biomass. Overall, these findings support the hypothesis that introduced earthworms facilitate particular plant species adapted to the abiotic conditions of earthworm-invaded forests. Further, our study provides evidence that introduced earthworms are associated with declines in plant diversity in North American forests. Changing plant functional composition in these forests may have long-lasting effects on ecosystem functioning.},

	abstract = {Soil ingested by Pontoscolex corethrurus Müller, a geophagous tropical earthworm, was transformed considerably during passage through the digestive tract. Readily-assimilable water-soluble compounds (mucus) with a high energy content represented 16 and 12.7\% of the dry mass of soil in the anterior and posterior intestine respectively but comprised only 0.12\% of the control soil and 0.43\% of the fresh casts. Water content increased from 35\% in the soil to 149\% in the anterior part of the gut; it was 122\% in the terminal part and 99\% in the fresh casts. Ingested soil of pH 4.6 was neutralized in the anterior part of the gut (pH 6.8); the pH decreased to 6.0 in the posterior part and declined to 4.8 in the casts. These physicochemical modifications and the intense mixing within the gizzard and gut stimulated an increase in the respiratory activity of the microflora ranging from 1.37 fold in the anterior part of the gut to 7.30-fold in the posterior part and declining to 1.69-fold in the casts. Thus, the microbial activity is first strongly stimulated by more favourable physical conditions and it increases as intestinal mucus is expended. The microflora appears to become more able to digest the more complex organic matter of the soil for the benefit of the earthworm. A mutualistic relationship is proposed between microflora and earthworms for the exploitation of the complex organic matter of tropical soils.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The positive effect of earthworms on soil processes and plant growth has been extensively documented. The capacity of earthworms to decompose organic matter has been attributed to the microbial communities that inhabit their digestive track or the structures they build, which in turn contribute to make up the drilosphere, a hotspot for microbial activity. However, how earthworms modify the structure of soil microbial communities and how these changes affect soil microbial processes is still unclear. Do earthworms reduce microbial abundance and activity because they feed on microorganisms or do they select and stimulate specific microbial groups? We hypothesise that “the effect of earthworms on nutrient cycling and plant growth is not only a direct effect but is mainly mediated indirectly, via modifications of the microbial community.” The objective of this review is to synthesize the existing literature concerning the influence of earthworms on the structure and function of soil microbial communities, as well as to understand how earthworm-induced changes in the soil microbiota would in turn impact soil processes, particularly those occurring in the rhizosphere and involved in plant growth and health. Recent reports have shown that specific bacterial groups consistently increase in soils where earthworms are present, regardless of the earthworm functional group. The extent of this increase seems to be dependent upon the type of substrate under study. Our synthesis also reveals that endogeic and anecic earthworms regularly induce an increase in soil nutrients, whilst this positive effect is not as evident in the presence of epigeic earthworms. The effect of earthworms on nutrient cycling has been further investigated with microbial functional genes, although existing reports largely focus on nitrogen cycling. Earthworms seem to enhance denitrification, most likely through the increase in organic compounds due to organic matter decomposition. By enhancing soil nutrient availability, earthworms indirectly promote plant growth, which has also been attributed to the induction of signal molecules. However, no experiment to date has been able to prove a direct causal relationship between specific signal molecules, earthworms and plant growth promotion. Finally, we propose a framework for earthworm-microbiota interactions and recommend further research.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Earthworms are considered as “ecosystem engineers” impacting soil properties as well as nutrient and element cycles. As they move through soil, earthworms secrete cutaneous mucus which is metabolized by soil microorganisms and a source of plant-available nutrients. Earthworm-processed soil contains carbon enriched, earthworm-specific soil aggregates (e.g. casts and middens) in comparison to earthworm unaffected soil. The reason could be that organic polymeric substances in earthworm mucus bind to soil minerals. The objective of this study was to investigate the small-scale interactions between earthworm mucus and secondary soil minerals, e.g. goethite and illite, leading to the formation of organo-mineral associations. We characterized the chemical composition of earthworm mucus by FTIR and 13C-NMR spectroscopy and compared spectra of mucus to microbial extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), an abundant and well-known type of organic matter that binds with soil minerals. Mucus from anecic (Lumbricus terrestris L.) and endogeic (Aporrectodea caliginosa Sav.) earthworm species was dominated by proteins and carbohydrates. Between 21 and 36\% of the total organic carbon in the mucus containing treatments adsorbed to illite and goethite, and most of the binding with goethite was associated with phosphorus containing mucus compounds. The surface charge of newly-formed organo-mineral associations was determined by measuring the isoelectric point (IEP). The IEP of mucus-goethite associations was 6.8, which was lower than the bare goethite IEP of 8.4. The zeta potential of mucus-illite associations was greater than bare illite. We conclude that the specific adsorption of earthworm mucus constituents to soil minerals leads to the formation of mucus-mineral associations. These associations contribute to retention of organic substances from earthworm mucus in soil (micro-)aggregates and explain the altered physicochemical properties of earthworm-formed aggregates in comparison to the earthworm unaffected “bulk” soil material.},

	abstract = {Background Soil organisms influence pedogenesis on a molecular level through the production of biopolymers which interact with soil minerals depending on their molecular properties. Specifically, biopolymers impact structure formation by inhibiting aggregation as a separation agent or promoting aggregation as a bridging agent. Mucus is a biopolymer excreted by earthworms that consists mainly of proteins, polysaccharides, and, to a lesser extent, lipids. However, despite earthworms’ fundamental contribution to soil quality and structuring via bioturbation, the role of mucus in aggregation still has to be unraveled. Aims Our study explores the role of cutaneous earthworm mucus (CEM) of Lumbricus terrestris L. for the formation of organo–mineral associations and aggregates, a sub-process of pedogenesis. Methods We conducted batch experiments with goethite and CEM at different pH values and varying CEM concentrations to form mucus–goethite associations. Employing the newly formed mucus–goethite associations, we explored the (homo-/hetero-)aggregation with quartz particles as a function of the loading of surfaces with mucus-C and CEM concentrations in solution. Results Our results suggest that the molecular structure of CEM constituents (especially proteins) is sensitive to pH. We found that the adsorption of CEM to goethite depends on pH and concentration. Polysaccharides of CEM adsorbed preferentially under acidic conditions (pH 3) and at low CEM concentration (6 mg mucus-C L–1). In contrast, stronger adsorption of proteins was observed at higher CEM concentrations (30 mg mucus-C L–1). In subsequent aggregation experiments, the hetero-aggregation rate of organo–mineral associations and quartz decreased at low C-loadings. Conversely, the rate increased at high loadings compared to the CEM-free reference. Furthermore, electrostatic/steric repulsion (separation agent) inhibited the aggregation between goethite particles at high CEM concentrations in the solution (mineral/mucus ratio of 17). However, at a low CEM supply (mineral/mucus ratio of {\textgreater}83), CEM took the role of a bridging agent. Conclusions The composition, function, and (im-)mobilization of CEM and corresponding organo–mineral associations in earthworm-influenced soil structures are shaped by the structure/reactivity of CEM affected by environmental parameters. Formation and aggregation of mucus–mineral associations contribute to nutrient/carbon storage and are involved in the structure formation in soil.},

Both leaf and soil material were labeled with fluorescent latex microbeads to allow a quantification of the food sources in the fore-, mid-, and hindgut of the earthworms. The content of leaf material in the gut varied in a range between 4 and 59\% of the total gut content in different earthworms and the different parts of the intestine of individual animals. Filamentous fungi in the gut compartments were found to originate mainly from leaf material (7700±1800 μg (g leaf (dry wt.))−1), however, the major part was disrupted before arriving in the intestine. Remaining hyphae in the foregut with a biomass of up to 900±150 μg (g gut content (dry wt.))−1 were completely digested during passage through the earthworm gut. Spores of fungi were not detected in our studies. Bacterial cell numbers in the gut compartments ranged from 63±5×108 to 327±16×108 (g gut content (dry wt.))−1 and were significantly higher than the numbers found in the soil (50±1×108 cells (g soil (dry wt.))−1). Cell numbers usually increased from fore- to hindgut. This increase was not correlated to contents of organic material and only partially due to a multiplication of bacterial cells. Numbers of dividing cells accounted in total for approximately 12\% of all bacteria, increasing significantly from fore- to hindgut, counts were from 10±1×108 to 25±2×108 (g gut content (dry wt.))−1, respectively. Average cell volumes of bacteria calculated from cell size distributions in leaf and soil material differed significantly, being 0.197 and 0.063 μm3, respectively. In the gut compartments, average cell volumes ranged from 0.043 to 0.070 μm3, which may indicate the disruption of large cells originating from the leaves before arriving in the foregut.},

However, microbiota dysbiosis can lead to dysregulation of bodily functions and diseases including cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), cancers, respiratory diseases, etc. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge of how microbiota links to host health or pathogenesis. We first summarize the research of microbiota in healthy conditions, including the gut-brain axis, colonization resistance and immune modulation. Then, we highlight the pathogenesis of microbiota dysbiosis in disease development and progression, primarily associated with dysregulation of community composition, modulation of host immune response, and induction of chronic inflammation. Finally, we introduce the clinical approaches that utilize microbiota for disease treatment, such as microbiota modulation and fecal microbial transplantation.},

	abstract = {The moment the soil enters into contact with an earthworm, both superficially and internally, physicochemical and biological changes take place. The drilosphere represents the whole soil volume under earthworm influence. Thus it includes the body surfaces, the gut and all the internal features of the worm that are in contact with the ingested soil, as well as the external structures (casts, burrows, middens) created by earthworm activities. The extent of the drilosphere and its particular characteristics depend on the species and ecological categories of the earthworm community present as well as the spatial and temporal scale of interest. Spatially, the drilosphere can interact with other soil functional domains and lead to significant changes in the litter system or detritusphere (generally decreasing litter stocks) and the rhizosphere (affecting both root biomass and density), the two main sources of organic matter (OM) additions to the soil, as well as in the aggregatusphere and the porosphere. Drilosphere effects on microbial activity and OM decomposition can be completely different (and opposite) depending on the spatio-temporal scale of observation. At the level of the gut, microbial activity is dramatically stimulated in a matter of a few hours via a mutualistic digestion system. In this process, water and soluble-C in the form of intestinal mucus (the Kiss) produced by the earthworm (Prince Charming) awakens the dormant microflora (Sleeping Beauties), thereby increasing decomposition of the stable forms of soil OM ingested. During gut passage populations of other organisms (e.g. protozoa, nematodes, fungi) may decline with digestion, although these organisms probably form a minor component of the earthworm’s energy needs. In the casts and on the burrow walls, the abundant nutrient resources for soil microflora continue the priming effect of the gut, increasing over a short time period mineralization rates and plant nutrient bio-availability. However as castings, particularly of the ‘compacting group’, and burrow walls begin to dry and stabilize with age (days to weeks), OM decomposition, nutrient mineralization and microbial activity decrease, often reaching levels lower than uningested soil due to ‘protection’. Finally at the scale of years to decades and soil profile, it appears that the drilosphere can exert an important regulation on OM incorporation and turnover rates, and soil C stocks.},

Past research has demonstrated many positive impacts of earthworm activity on soil physical properties such as infiltration, aggregate stability, and water-holding capacity.

Past studies have also largely focused on determining the impact of earthworms on a single soil property or process. By using a combination of relatively new methodologies such as tomography and advanced microspectroscopic tools, the consequences of spatial reorganization by earthworms on biogeochemical properties may be determined. Likewise, microscale information on the biochemical environment will help elucidate processes through which earthworms alter soil physical properties. These types of microscale spatially explicit studies will be especially important in understanding how soil ecosystem engineers influence water and nutrient uptake by plants. This article focuses on reviewing our current state of knowledge regarding earthworm influences on physical properties and drilosphere-level studies of biogeochemical properties and processes.

	abstract = {Chalk grasslands are subject to vegetation dynamics that range from species-rich open grasslands to tall and encroached grasslands, and woods and forests. In grasslands, earthworms impact plant communities and ecosystem functioning through the modification of soil physical, chemical and microbiological properties, but also through their selective ingestion and vertical transportation of seeds from the soil seed bank. Laboratory experiments showed that seed–earthworm interactions are species specific, but little is known on the impact of seed–earthworm interactions in the field. The overall aim of this study was to better understand seed–earthworm interactions and their impact on the plant community. First we analyzed the composition of seedlings emerging from casts after earthworm ingestion. Then we compared seedling composition in casts to the plant composition of emerging seedlings from the soil and of the aboveground vegetation along four stages of the secondary succession of chalk grasslands.Four stages of the secondary succession of a chalk grassland—from open sward to woods—were sampled in Upper Normandy, France, in February 2010. Within each successional stage (×3 replicates), we sampled the standing vegetation, soil seed bank at three soil depths (0–2, 2–5 and 5–10cm) and earthworm surface casts along transects. Soil and cast samples were water sieved before samples were spread onto trays and placed into a greenhouse. Emerging seedlings were counted and identified. Effect of successional stage and origin of samples on mean and variability of abundance and species richness of seedlings emerging from casts and soil seed banks were analyzed. Plant compositions were compared between all sample types. We used generalized mixed-effect models and a distance-based redundancy multivariate analysis.Seedling abundance was always higher in earthworm casts than in the soil seed bank and increased up to 5-fold, 4-fold and 3.5-fold, respectively, in the tall grassland, woods and encroached grassland compared to the soil surface layer. Species richness was also higher in earthworm casts than in the soil seed bank in all successional stages, with a 4-fold increase in the encroached grassland. The plant composition of the standing vegetation was more similar to that of seedlings from casts than to that of seedlings from the soil seed bank. Seedlings diversity emerging from casts in the tall and encroached grasslands tended toward the diversity found in woods. Our results indicate that earthworms may promote the emergence of seedlings. We also suggest that the loss of some plant species in the seed bank and the tall grass vegetation in intermediary successional stages modify the local conditions and prevent the further establishment of early-successional plant species.},

	abstract = {Soil seed bank composition and dynamics are crucial elements for the understanding of plant population and community ecology. Earthworms are increasingly recognized as important dispersers and predators of seeds. Through direct and indirect effects they influence either positively or negatively the establishment and survival of seeds and seedlings. Seedling establishment is affected by a variety of earthworm-mediated mechanisms, such as selective seed ingestion and digestion, acceleration or deceleration of germination, and seed transport. Earthworm casts deposited on the soil surface and the entrance of earthworm burrows often contain viable seeds and constitute important regeneration niches for plant seedlings and therefore likely favour specific seed traits. However, the role of earthworms as seed dispersers, mediators of seed bank dynamics and seed predators has not been considered in concert. The overall effect of earthworms on plant communities remains little understood. Most knowledge is based on laboratory studies on temperate species and future work has to explore the biological significance of earthworm–seed interactions under more natural conditions. In this review we summarize the current knowledge on earthworm–seed interactions and discuss factors determining these interactions. We highlight that this interaction may be an underappreciated, yet major driving force for the dynamics of soil seed banks and plant communities which most likely have experienced co-evolutionary processes. Despite the experimental bias, we hypothesize that the knowledge gathered in the present review is of crucial relevance for restoration and conservation ecology. For instance, as earthworms emerge as successful and ubiquitous invaders in various ecosystems, the summarized information might serve as a basis for realistic estimations and modelling of consequences on native plant communities. We depict promising directions of future research and point to the need to consider above- and belowground interactions in order to mechanistically understand the driving forces of plant community assembly.},

In most of the studies (79\%) shoot biomass of plants significanty increased in the presence of earthworms. However, knowledge on effects of earthworms on plant growth is very biased; most studies investigated crop plants, particularly cereals, and pastures; very little is known on plant species in more natural communities. Recently, interest in tropical plant species has increased considerably, however, the studies have considered almost exclusively agricultural plant species. Generally, experiments focused on the response of plant shoots but 45\% of the studies also considered roots. Most of the studies investigated European earthworms (Lumbricidae); very little is known on other earthworm species. Some early studies indicated that earthworms affect the composition of plant communities but only very recently has it been documented that earthworms affect plant competition. However, there is virtually no information on how earthworms affect plant performance in detail including fitness parameters such as flowering and seed production. It has been realized recently that earthworms not only modify plant growth and vegetation structure but also the susceptability of plants to herbivores. Herbivore performance might be stimulated but also reduced due to the presence of earthworms. Furthermore, earthworms function as subsidiary food resources to generalist predators when herbivore prey is scarce. The complex indirect interactions between earthworms and the aboveground system deserve further investigation in both natural and agricultural ecosystems. The imperative for future research is adopting an ecological rather than an agricultural perspective in studying earthworm-plant interrelationships and viewing earthworms as driving factors of the aboveground food web. It is suggested that studies on earthworm-plant interactions may contribute significantly to a more comprehensive understanding of terrestrial ecosystems and to the development of more environmentally friendly agricultural practices.},

Earthworms are among the most important soil dwelling invertebrates. Their activity affects both biotic and abiotic soil properties, in turn affecting plant growth. Yet, studies on the effect of earthworm presence on crop yields have not been quantitatively synthesized. Here we show, using meta-analysis, that on average earthworm presence in agroecosystems leads to a 25\% increase in crop yield and a 23\% increase in aboveground biomass. The magnitude of these effects depends on presence of crop residue, earthworm density and type and rate of fertilization. The positive effects of earthworms become larger when more residue is returned to the soil, but disappear when soil nitrogen availability is high. This suggests that earthworms stimulate plant growth predominantly through releasing nitrogen locked away in residue and soil organic matter. Our results therefore imply that earthworms are of crucial importance to decrease the yield gap of farmers who can't -or won't- use nitrogen fertilizer.},

High densities of several earthworm species may decrease native biodiversity and disrupt restoration efforts in tallgrass prairies. This affects efforts to conserve and restore such habitat, which is of high conservation and restoration priority in eastern North America and typically restored through seeding events. To date, Lumbricus terrestris (Lumbricidae) and other species have remained largely undocumented in tallgrass prairies. We surveyed 22 tallgrass prairie sites in southern Ontario, Canada, to document earthworm density and species. Lumbricus terrestris was found at all sites. The average density was 66 ± 91 (SD) earthworms/m2 across our sampling plots, mostly juveniles ({\textasciitilde}94\%). The number of all earthworms per plot significantly increased with the number of earthworm middens in each plot (χ21 = 4.50, P = 0.034). Prairies with a large number of middens had high earthworm density, but middens alone appear to explain little variation in our data (linear mixed-effects model, marginal R2 = 0.12) meaning there are other biologically important factors that affect their density. However, we found no effects of soil pH, organic matter content, or texture on the number earthworms per plot suggesting that earthworms can invade a range of tallgrass prairie soils with pH values between 5.27 and 7.67.},

	abstract = {Hardwood forests of the Great Lakes Region have evolved without earthworms since the Last Glacial Maximum, but are now being invaded by exotic earthworms introduced through agriculture, fishing, and logging. These exotic earthworms are known to increase soil mixing, affect soil carbon storage, and dramatically alter soil morphology. Here we show, using an active earthworm invasion chronosequence in a hardwood forest in northern Minnesota, that such disturbances by exotic earthworms profoundly affect inorganic nutrient cycles in soils. Soil nutrient elemental concentrations (Ca, Mg, K, and P) were normalized to biogeochemically inert Zr to quantify their losses and gains. This geochemical normalization revealed that elements were highly enriched in the A horizon of pre-invasion soils, suggesting tight biological recycling of the nutrients. In the early stage of invasion, epi-endogeic earthworm species appeared to have been responsible for further enriching the elements in the A horizon possibly by incorporating leaf organic matter (OM). The arrival of geophagous soil mixing endogeic earthworms, however, was associated with near complete losses of these enrichments, which was related to the loss of OM in soils. Our study highlights that elemental concentrations may not be sufficient to quantify biogeochemical effects of earthworms. The geochemical normalization approach, which has been widely used to study soil formation, may help when determining how invasive soil organisms affect soil elemental cycles. More generally, this approach has potential for much wider use in studies of belowground nutrient dynamics. The results support the existing ecological literature demonstrating that invasive earthworms may ultimately reduce productivity in formerly glaciated forests under climate change.},

Leading edges of earthworm invasion in forests of northern Minnesota provide a rare opportunity to document changes in soil characteristics as earthworm invasions are occurring. Across leading edges of earthworm invasion in four northern hardwood stands, increasing total earthworm biomass was associated with rapid disappearance of the O horizon. Concurrently, the thickness, bulk density and total soil organic matter content of the A horizon increased, and it’s percent organic matter and fine root density decreased. Different earthworm species assemblages influenced the magnitude and type of change in these soil parameters. Soil N and P availability were lower in plots with high earthworm biomass compared to plots with low worm biomass. Decreases in soil nitrogen availability associated with high earthworm biomass were reflected in decreased foliar nitrogen content for Carex pensylvanica, Acer saccharum and Asarum canadense but increased foliar N for Athyrium felix-femina. Overall, high earthworm biomass resulted in increased foliar carbon to nitrogen ratios. The effects of earthworm species assemblages on forest soil properties are related to their feeding and burrowing habits in addition to effects related to total biomass. The potential for large ecosystem consequences following exotic earthworm invasion has only recently been recognized by forest ecologists. In the face of rapid change and multiple pressures on native forest ecosystems, the impacts of earthworm invasion on forest soil structure and function must be considered.},

Treatments included: (1) control with no earthworms, (2) Diplocardia spp. only, and (3) O. tyrtaeum only. Prior to addition of earthworms, seedlings of Andropogon gerardii (a dominant tallgrass) were established in each core, and a dilute solution of 13C-labeled glucose and 15N-labeled (NH4)2SO4 was added to the soil to facilitate examination of earthworm/microbe/plant interactions. We found that Diplocardia spp. were significantly more active than O. tyrtaeum, and quickly assimilated 13C and 15N from the tracer. Individuals of Diplocardia spp. were present at shallower soil depths than O. tyrtaeum throughout the study. Contrary to expectation, this greater activity of Diplocardia spp. did not result in increased plant productivity. Rather, the activity of Diplocardia spp. was associated with less plant growth and smaller amounts of N acquired by A. gerardii seedlings compared to controls or O. tyrtaeum treatments. We observed few significant influences of earthworm treatments on microbial biomass C or N pool sizes, but the microbial C/N ratio was consistently greater in the presence of Diplocardia spp. relative to O. tyrtaeum. Results of this study indicate that activity of earthworms may enhance competition for N between microbes and plants during the growing season in tallgrass prairie.},

	abstract = {The responses of tallgrass prairie plant communities and ecosystem processes to fire and grazing are well characterized. However, responses of invertebrate consumer groups, and particularly soil-dwelling organisms, to these disturbances are not well known. At Konza Prairie Biological Station, we sampled soil macroinvertebrates in 1994 and 1999 as part of a long-term experiment designed to examine the effects and interactions of annual fire, mowing, and fertilization (N and P) on prairie soil communities and processes. For nearly all taxa, in both years, responses were characterized by significant treatment interactions, but some general patterns were evident. Introduced European earthworms (Aporrectodea spp. and Octolasion spp.) were most abundant in plots where fire was excluded, and the proportion of the total earthworm community consisting of introduced earthworms was greater in unburned, unmowed, and fertilized plots. Nymphs of two Cicada genera were collected (Cicadetta spp. and Tibicen spp.). Cicadetta nymphs were more abundant in burned plots, but mowing reduced their abundance. Tibicen nymphs were collected almost exclusively from unburned plots. Treatment effects on herbivorous beetle larvae (Scarabaeidae, Elateridae, and Curculionidae) were variable, but nutrient additions (N or P) usually resulted in greater densities, whereas mowing usually resulted in lower densities. Our results suggest that departures from historical disturbance regimes (i.e. frequent fire and grazing) may render soils more susceptible to increased numbers of European earthworms, and that interactions between fire, aboveground biomass removal, and vegetation responses affect the structure and composition of invertebrate communities in tallgrass prairie soils.},

These changes include the mixing of organic and mineral soil horizons, decreases in soil C storage, and equivocal effects on N cycling.

Soils of north temperate forests harbor a tremendous diversity of microorganisms and invertebrates, whose distribution and abundance can be substantially altered by earthworm invasion. Furthermore, invasive earthworms can affect understory plant communities, raising concerns over the loss of rare native herbs in some areas. The ecological consequences of earthworm invasion are mediated through physical, geochemical, and biological effects. These effects vary with different earthworm species, as well as with the characteristics of the site being invaded.

	abstract = {Earthworm invasion in North American forests has the potential to greatly impact soil microbial communities by altering soil physicochemical properties, including structure, pH, nutrient availability, and soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics. While most research on the topic has been carried out in northern temperate forests, little is known about the impact of invasive earthworms on soil microbial communities in hemiboreal and boreal forests, characterized by a slower decay of organic matter (OM). Earthworm activities can increase OM mineralization, altering nutrient cycling and biological activity in a biome where low carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) availability typically limits microbial and plant growth. Here, we characterized and compared microbial communities of earthworm-invaded and non-invaded soils in previously described sites across three major soil types found in the Canadian (hemi)boreal forest using a space-for-time approach. Microbial communities of forest floors and surface mineral soils were characterized using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis and metabarcoding of the 16S rRNA gene for bacteria and archaea and of the internal-transcriber-spacer-2 (ITS2) region for fungi. In forest floors, the effects of earthworm invasion were minor. In mineral soil horizons, earthworm invasion was associated with higher fungal biomass and greater relative abundance of ectomycorrhizal fungi. Oligotrophic bacteria (Acidobacteriota and Chloroflexi) were less abundant in invaded mineral soils, where Gram(+) : Gram(−) ratios were also lower, while the opposite was observed for the copiotrophic Bacteroidota. Additionally, earthworm-invaded mineral soils harboured higher fungal and bacterial species diversity and richness. Considering the important role of soil microbial communities for ecosystem functioning, such earthworm-induced shifts in their community composition are likely to impact nutrient cycling, as well as vegetation development and forest productivity at a large scale, as the invasion progresses in these (hemi)boreal systems.},

Key to this success is their flexible body plan with metameric trunk segments and bipartite heads consisting of a prostomium bearing sensory structures and a peristomium containing the mouth. The flexibility of this body plan has traditionally proven problematic for reconstructing the evolutionary relationships within the Annelida. Although recent phylogenies have focused on resolving the interrelationships of the crown group [1-3], many questions remain regarding the early evolution of the annelid body plan itself, including the origin of the head [4]. Here we describe an abundant and exceptionally well-preserved polychaete with traces of putative neural and vascular tissues for the first time in a fossilized annelid. Up to three centimeters in length, Kootenayscolex barbarensis gen. et sp. nov. is described based on more than 500 specimens from Marble Canyon [5] and several specimens from the original Burgess Shale site (both in British Columbia, Canada). K. barbarensis possesses biramous parapodia along the trunk, bearing similar elongate and thin notochaetae and neurochaetae. A pair of large palps and one median antenna project from the anteriormost dorsal margin of the prostomium. The mouth-bearing peristomium bears neuropodial chaetae, a condition that is also inferred in Canadia and Burgessochaeta from the Burgess Shale, suggesting a chaetigorous origin for the peristomial portion of the head and a secondary loss of peristomial parapodia and chaetae in modern polychaetes.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT
This checklist of the terrestrial Oligochaeta of Ontario was based on 480 collection sites from all the 53 counties, districts and regions in the province. In total, 21 species representing 11 genera and three families (Lumbricidae, Megascolecidae and Sparganophilidae) are reported from the province. Of these 21 species, two (Bimastos parvus and Sparganophilus eiseni) are considered native (endemic) to North America; the rest are European or Oriental exotic species. The most frequently collected species were: Aporrectodea tuberculata (274 sites), Ap. turgida (164 sites), Ap. rosea (143 sites), Lumbricus rubellus (139 sites), L. terrestris (134 sites), and Ap. trapezoides (101 sites). The remaining 16 species were collected from fewer than 64 sites each. The first records of Amynthas agrestis and Am. hilgendorfi in Canada are reported herein. Individual county sites include the ecoregion and a map location, as well as the species obtained, indicating the frequency and per cent of the total county collections.

	abstract = {A recent review concluded that earthworm presence increases CO2 emissions by 33\% but does not affect soil organic carbon stocks. However, the findings are controversial and raise new questions. Here we hypothesize that neither an increase in CO2 emission nor in stabilized carbon would entirely reflect the earthworms’ contribution to net carbon sequestration. We show how two widespread earthworm invaders affect net carbon sequestration through impacts on the balance of carbon mineralization and carbon stabilization. Earthworms accelerate carbon activation and induce unequal amplification of carbon stabilization compared with carbon mineralization, which generates an earthworm-mediated ‘carbon trap’. We introduce the new concept of sequestration quotient to quantify the unequal processes. The patterns of CO2 emission and net carbon sequestration are predictable by comparing sequestration quotient values between treatments with and without earthworms. This study clarifies an ecological mechanism by which earthworms may regulate the terrestrial carbon sink.},

In the first experiment material from four soil layers of an aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) forest (L, F, H, Ah) and from F/H layers of a pine (Pinus contorta Loud.) forest was placed separately in laboratory systems. In this experiment the effect of Dendrobaena octaedra (Savigny) on nutrient leaching (N and P) and on carbon mineralization was monitored at regular intervals for 84 days. In addition, microbial biomass (substrate induced respiration (SIR) was determined at the end of the experiment. In the second experiment the effect of two earthworm species (D. octaedra and Octolasion lacteum (Oerley)) on nutrient leaching, carbon turnover, microbial biomass and bacterial/fungal ratio in reconstructed aspen forest floor was determined at destructive samplings after 28, 56 and 84 days of incubation. In addition, the effect of the earthworms on the composition of the fungal community in L/F layer was studied after 56 days of incubation. D. octaedra caused a strong increase in leaching of mineral N and P from organic soil materials but not from aspen Ah. The effect of the earthworms increased during the incubation in most of the layers. In aspen L, Ah and pine F/H D. octaedra caused a significant increase in NH4+/NO3− ratio in leachates; in aspen F and H leaching of mineral nitrogen occurred almost exclusively as NO3− irrespective of earthworms. D. octaedra generally caused a reduction in microbial biomass. In the second experiment the effect of D. octaedra on nutrient leaching was assumed to be masked by internal nutrient immobilization. Microbial biomass in L/F layer was reduced by both earthworm species but enhanced in H and Ah layer which was assumed to be caused by mixing of soil layer materials. Bacterial/fungal ratio was generally increased by both earthworm species in L/F and Ah material but no effect was found in H layer. The dominance structure of the fungal community was modified by the earthworms but the effect was small. Carbon turnover was generally not significantly affected by earthworms in both experiments.},

Our objectives were to assess the influence of exotic earthworm invasion on (a) the amount and depth distribution of soil C and N, (b) soil δ13C and δ15N, and (c) soil solution chemistry and leaching of C and N in forests with different land-use histories. At a relatively undisturbed forest site (Arnot Forest), earthworms eliminated the thick forest floor, decreased soil C storage in the upper 12 cm by 28\%, and reduced soil C:N ratios from 19.2 to 15.3. At a previously cultivated forest site with little forest floor (Tompkins Farm), earthworms did not influence the storage of soil C or N or soil C:N ratios. Earthworms altered the stable isotopic signature of soil at Arnot Forest but not at Tompkins Farm; the alteration of stable isotopes indicated that earthworms significantly increased the loss of forest floor C but not N from the soil profile at Arnot Forest. Nitrate (NO3−) concentrations in tension and zero-tension lysimeters were much greater at Tompkins Farm than Arnot Forest, and earthworms increased NO3− leaching at Tompkins Farm. The results suggest that the effect of earthworm invasion on the distribution, retention, and solution chemistry of soil C and N in northern temperate forests may depend on the initial quantity and quality of soil organic matter at invaded sites.},

We measured the distribution and activity of microbial biomass in forest stands invaded by earthworms and in adjacent stands lacking earthworms in sugar maple-dominated forests in two locations in New York State, USA: one with a history of cultivation and thin organic surface soil horizons (forest floors) and the other with no history of cultivation and a thick (3–5 cm) forest floor. Earthworm invasion greatly reduced pools of microbial biomass in the forest floor and increased pools in the mineral soil. Enrichment of the mineral soil was much more marked at the site with thick forest floors. The increase in microbial biomass carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) in the mineral soil at this site was larger than the decrease in the forest floor, resulting in a net increase in total soil profile microbial biomass in the invaded plots. There was an increase in respiration in the mineral soil at both sites, which is consistent with a movement of organic matter and microbial biomass into the mineral soil. However, N-cycle processes (mineralization and nitrification) did not increase along with respiration. It is likely that the earthworm-induced input of C into the mineral soil created a microbial “sink” for N, preventing an increase in net mineralization and nitrification and conserving N in the soil profile.},

	abstract = {Over the past few decades there has been increasing concern that boreal forests could convert from a carbon sink to a carbon source, thus accentuating the effects of climate change. Although forest fires are generally regarded as mainly responsible for causing boreal forests to transition to a carbon source, other factors, such as the activity of exotic earthworm species, could also play an important role. Invasive and exotic species of earthworm can affect nutrient cycling, biodiversity, and forest dynamics. In this context, greater knowledge of the distribution of exotic species of earthworm could help researchers to understand the likely changes in the ecosystems that they have colonized. Herein, we report the results of an exhaustive literature review of the presence of exotic species of earthworm in the Canadian boreal forest and taiga zones. We identified 230 sectors containing 14 earthworm species (11 exotic, two native, and one putative native) in six provinces and three territories across Canada’s boreal forest and taiga zone. We also report 23 as-yet unpublished observations from the province of Quebec. We noted the presence of earthworms in environments (acid soils, harsh climate) that were historically considered inadequate for their survival. This suggests that the portion of Canada’s boreal forests suitable for the presence or colonization of exotic species of earthworm is larger than was previously believed. This study represents the first compilation of locations with exotic species of earthworm in this large northern area. Factors that could affect their distribution and potential effects on boreal ecosystems are also discussed. We also report that several earthworm species seem to be overcoming the previously assumed limitations of temperature and soil pH.},

Leading edges of earthworm invasion provide an opportunity to investigate the response of understory plant communities to earthworm invasion and whether the species composition of the earthworm community influences that response. Four sugar maple-dominated forest sites with active earthworm invasions were identified in the Chippewa National Forest in north central Minnesota, USA. In each site, we established a 30 × 150 m sample grid that spanned a visible leading edge of earthworm invasion and sampled earthworm populations and understory vegetation over four years. Across leading edges of earthworm invasion, increasing total earthworm biomass was associated with decreasing diversity and abundance of herbaceous plants in two of four study sites, and the abundance and density of tree seedlings decreased in three of four study sites. Sample points with the most diverse earthworm species assemblage, independent of biomass, had the lowest plant diversity. Changes in understory plant community composition were most affected by increasing biomass of the earthworm species Lumbricus rubellus. Where L. rubellus was absent there was a diverse community of native herbaceous plants, but where L. rubellus biomass reached its maximum, the herbaceous-plant community was dominated by Carex pensylvanica and Arisaema triphyllum and, in some cases, was completely absent. Evidence from these forest sites suggests that earthworm invasion can lead to dramatic changes in the understory community and that the nature of these changes is influenced by the species composition of the invading earthworm community.},

Densities of earthworm species, soil structure, plant coverage and abundance were determined along three transects starting at the edge of the forest. At locations with L. terrestris, litter was incorporated into the soil, and where O. tyrtaeum was present, organic layers were mixed with mineral soil layers. Organic layers disappeared almost entirely when both species occurred together. Carbon and nitrogen concentrations were reduced in organic layers in the presence of L. terrestris and O. tyrtaeum. Microbial biomass and basal respiration were reduced when L. terrestris and O. tyrtaeum were present, presumably due to resource competition and habitat destruction. Microarthropod densities and the number of microarthropod species were strongly reduced in the presence of O. tyrtaeum (−75\% and −22\%, respectively), probably through mechanical disturbances, increasing compactness of the soil and resource competition. The coverage of some plant species was correlated with earthworm abundance, but the coverage of others was not. Despite harsh climatic conditions, the invasion of boreal forest ecosystems by mineral soil dwelling earthworm species is proceeding and strongly impacts soil structure, soil chemistry, microorganisms, soil microarthropods and vegetation.},

	abstract = {Earthworms are keystone detritivores that can influence primary producers by changing seedbed conditions, soil characteristics, flow of water, nutrients and carbon, and plant-herbivore interactions. The invasion of European earthworms into previously earthworm-free temperate and boreal forests of North America dominated by Acer, Quercus, Betula, Pinus and Populus has provided ample opportunity to observe how earthworms engineer ecosystems. Impacts vary with soil parent material, land use history, and assemblage of invading earthworm species. Earthworms reduce the thickness of organic layers, increase the bulk density of soils and incorporate litter and humus materials into deeper horizons of the soil profile, thereby affecting the whole soil food web and the above ground plant community. Mixing of organic and mineral materials turns mor into mull humus which significantly changes the distribution and community composition of the soil microflora and seedbed conditions for vascular plants. In some forests earthworm invasion leads to reduced availability and increased leaching of N and P in soil horizons where most fine roots are concentrated. Earthworms can contribute to a forest decline syndrome, and forest herbs in the genera Aralia, Botrychium, Osmorhiza, Trillium, Uvularia, and Viola are reduced in abundance during earthworm invasion. The degree of plant recovery after invasion varies greatly among sites and depends on complex interactions with soil processes and herbivores. These changes are likely to alter competitive relationships among plant species, possibly facilitating invasion of exotic plant species such as Rhamnus cathartica into North American forests, leading to as yet unknown changes in successional trajectory.},

	abstract = {The invasion of non-native earthworms (Lumbricus spp.) into a small number of intensively studied stands of northern hardwood forest has been linked to declines in plant diversity and the local extirpation of one threatened species. It is unknown, however, whether these changes have occurred across larger regions of hardwood forests, which plant species are most vulnerable, or with which earthworm species such changes are associated most closely. To address these issues we conducted a regional survey in the Chippewa and Chequamegon national forests in Minnesota and Wisconsin (U.S.A.), respectively. We sampled earthworms, soils, and vegetation, examined deer browse in 20 mature, sugar-maple-dominated forest stands in each national forest, and analyzed the relationship between invasive earthworms and vascular plant species richness and composition. Invasion by Lumbricus was a strong indicator of reduced plant richness in both national forests. The mass of Lumbricus juveniles was significantly and negatively related to plant-species richness in both forests. In addition, Lumbricus was a significant factor affecting plant richness in a full model that included multiple variables. In the Chequamegon National Forest earthworm mass was associated with higher sedge cover and lower cover of sugar maple seedlings and several forb species. The trends were similar but not as pronounced in Chippewa, perhaps due to lower deer densities and different earthworm species composition. Our results provide regional evidence that invasion by Lumbricus species may be an important mechanism in reduced plant-species richness and changes in plant communities in mature forests dominated by sugar maples.},

As a consequence, soil taxa such as earthworms are iconic in good land management practices. However, their introduction in places where species did not co-evolve with them can trigger catastrophic changes. This issue has been largely ignored so far in nature management policies because of the positive image of soil taxa and the lack of knowledge of the magnitude of soil fauna introductions outside their native range. Here we address this gap with a large spatio-temporal database of introduced alien earthworms. We show that 70 alien earthworm species have colonized the North American continent. They have larger geographical ranges than native species and novel ecological functions, representing a serious threat to the biodiversity and functioning of native ecosystems. The probably continuous introduction of alien earthworms, from a variety of sources and introduction pathways, into many distant and often empty niches, contrasts with the classical patterns of invasions in most aboveground taxa. This suggests that earthworms, and probably other soil organisms, constitute a major but overlooked pool of invasive species that are not adequately managed by existing control and mitigation strategies.},

However, despite several studies assessing impacts of invasive earthworms on soil fauna, studies have rarely investigated the simultaneous responses of different soil-fauna size groups and biodiversity facets which might respond differently to earthworm invasion and independently affect ecosystem processes. Our study goes beyond previously-established knowledge on earthworm-invasion effects by simultaneously assessing differences in four biodiversity facets, namely the abundance, biomass, richness and Shannon index of soil invertebrate macro-, meso- and microfauna communities between high- and low-invasion status plots (n = 80) and in relation to invasion intensity measured as earthworm biomass across four northern North American forests sampled between 2016 and 2017. Across forests and soil-fauna groups, we found reduced abundance (−33 to −45\%) and richness (−18 to −25\%) in high compared to low-invasion status areas. Additionally, meso- (−14\%) and microfauna biomass (−38\%) and macro- (−7\%) and microfauna Shannon index (−8\%) were reduced. Higher invasion intensity (earthworm biomass) was additionally related to reduced soil-fauna biodiversity. While the studied biodiversity facet was important for the soil fauna response, soil-fauna size group was comparably unimportant. Given the global ubiquity of earthworm invasion and the importance of soil fauna for key ecosystem processes, our observational results help to assess future impacts of this invasion and the consequences for anthropogenically-altered ecosystem functioning.},

	abstract = {Earthworms represent the dominant fraction of soil macroinvertebrate biomass in Kansas tallgrass prairie and thus may have a large impact on nutrient budgets. To evaluate this impact I estimated cast production and rates of nutrient processing by the native genus Diplocardia and by exotic Lumbricidae in permanent plots on two soil types at Konza Prairie Research Natural Area. Total cast production was estimated from field population estimates, soil climate data, and cast production—temperature relationships obtained in the laboratory. The organic matter and mineral N and P contents of surface casts by month were used to estimate total processing of these substances in the field. Earthworms present in the study sites were Diplocardia longiseta, D. kansensis, D. rugosa, D. singularis, D. smithii, D. verrucosa, and the European species Aporrectodea caliginosa and Octolasion cyaneum. Estimated total cast production and nutrient processing by Diplocardia spp. exceeded that of exotics in both soil types, in spite of higher populations of Lumbricidae in one soil. Total annual soil consumption by all earthworms was 4—10\% of the A—horizon, depending on soil type. Organic matter equivalent to 10\% of total soil organic matter in the top 15 cm or to 100—300\% of plant annual belowground production appears to pass through the earthworms each year. Mineral N processed was °10—12\% of annual plant N uptake, comparable to half of the input from precipitation, while the P processed was equivalent to 50\% of annual uptake. In contrast to other grassland systems studied, the introduction of Lumbricidae had a negative effect on soil turnover and nutrient mineralization due to the lower throughput of Lumbricidae and their relative intolerance of summer soil temperatures.},

Two transects were aligned parallel to previously defined gradients of earthworm density and were sampled in the spring and summer of 2008. We found plots codominated by multiple earthworm species decreased belowground seed abundance and species richness. Aboveground plant cover and diversity along with soil organic matter was lower along the transect with multiple earthworm species. In addition, we found earthworm density increased with soil pH, but did not detect relationships with soil texture or light intensity. Our results were consistent with previous findings of earthworms negatively affecting aboveground plant communities and soil organic matter, and increasing pH. Our study demonstrates the potential for exotic earthworms to dramatically alter forest soil seed banks; however, future research is needed to investigate complexities of earthworm community dynamics (e.g., number and life form of earthworm species) and to tease apart mechanisms responsible for changes in the belowground plant community.},

This occurs at a midpoint in the trophic pyramid, unlike the more familiar bottom-up or top-down cascades. These cascades cause fundamental changes (“microcascade effects”) in soil morphology, bulk density, and nutrient leaching, and a shift to warmer, drier soil surfaces with a loss of leaf litter. In North American temperate and boreal forests, microcascade effects can affect carbon sequestration, disturbance regimes, soil and water quality, forest productivity, plant communities, and wildlife habitat, and can facilitate other invasive species. These broader-scale changes (“macrocascade effects”) are of greater concern to society. Interactions among these fundamental changes and broader-scale effects create “cascade complexes” that interact with climate change and other environmental processes. The diversity of cascade effects, combined with the vast area invaded by earthworms, leads to regionally important changes in ecological functioning.},

Invasions by ecosystem engineers, in particular, have been shown to have dramatic effects in recipient ecosystems. For instance, invasion by earthworms, a below-ground invertebrate ecosystem engineer, in previously earthworm-free ecosystems alters the physico-chemical characteristics of the soil. Studies have shown that such alterations in the soil can have far-reaching impacts on soil organisms, which form a major portion of terrestrial biodiversity. Here, we present the first quantitative synthesis of earthworm invasion effects on soil micro-organisms and soil invertebrates based on 430 observations from 30 independent studies. Our meta-analysis shows a significant decline of the diversity and density of soil invertebrates in response to earthworm invasion with anecic and endogeic earthworms causing the strongest effects. Earthworm invasion effects on soil micro-organisms were context-dependent, such as depending on functional group richness of invasive earthworms and soil depth. Microbial biomass and diversity increased in mineral soil layers, with a weak negative effect in organic soil layers, indicating that the mixing of soil layers by earthworms (bioturbation) may homogenize microbial communities across soil layers. Our meta-analysis provides a compelling evidence for negative effects of a common invasive below-ground ecosystem engineer on below-ground biodiversity of recipient ecosystems, which could potentially alter the ecosystem functions and services linked to soil biota.},

	abstract = {Terrestrial systems support a variety of free-living soil diazotrophs, which can fix nitrogen (N) outside of plant associations. However, owing to the metabolic costs associated with N fixation, free-living soil diazotrophs likely rely on soil N to satisfy the majority of cellular N demand and only fix atmospheric N under certain conditions. Culture-based studies and genomic data show that many free-living soil diazotrophs can access high-molecular weight organic soil N by releasing N-acquiring enzymes such as proteases and chitinases into the extracellular environment. Here, we formally propose a N acquisition strategy used by free-living diazotrophs that accounts for high-molecular weight N acquisition through exoenzyme release by these organisms. We call this the ‘LAH N-acquisition strategy’ for the preferred order of N pools used once inorganic soil N is limiting: (1) low-molecular weight organic N, (2) atmospheric N and (3) high-molecular weight organic N. In this framework, free-living diazotrophs primarily use biological N fixation (BNF) as a short-term N acquisition strategy to offset the cellular N lost in exoenzyme excretion as low-molecular weight N becomes limiting. By accounting for exoenzyme release by free-living diazotrophs within a cost–benefit framework, investigation of the LAH N acquisition strategy will contribute to a process-level understanding of BNF in soil environments.},

Furthermore, the way in which ecological interactions are organized into a network and the interaction strengths connecting species may be important for cascading effects. Previous work revealed that network structure determines how cascading effects spread across species assemblages. A next step is to understand how interaction strengths influence cascading effects. Here, we assume that perturbations have negative effects, and we evaluate whether interaction strength affects network robustness to cascading effects in mutualistic interactions, and examine the role of network structure in mediating perturbation cascades when interaction strength is incorporated. We combine empirical data on 18 mutualistic networks, two simulations scenarios, and network theory, to investigate how network structure affects perturbation spreading time, a proxy of network robustness to cascading effects. Simulations in which we included interaction strength presented higher mean spreading time, indicating that interaction strength increases network robustness. Richness, modularity, and nestedness had a strong, positive effect, on mean perturbation spreading time regardless of the interaction strengths. We found that network structure and the distribution of interaction strengths affected communities’ robustness to perturbation spreading. Our results contribute to the discussion on the danger that ecosystems face when species, and interactions alike, become extinct.},

However, the amount and global distribution of this fixation is highly disputed. Using a comprehensive meta-analysis of field measurements, we make a new assessment of global biological nitrogen fixation (BNF). We assessed the relationship between BNF in natural terrestrial environments and empirical predictors of BNF commonly used in terrestrial ecosystem and earth system models. We found no evidence for any statistically significant relationship between BNF and evapotranspiration and net or gross primary terrestrial productivity. We assessed the relationship between BNF and 11 other climate variables and soil properties at a global scale. We found that all the variables we considered had little predictive power for BNF. Using averaged biome values upscaled we calculated the median global inputs of BNF in natural ecosystems as 88 Tg N year−1. The range (52–130 Tg N year−1) encompasses most recent estimates and broadly agrees with recent independent top-down estimates of BNF. The global values indicate a significant role for free living, as opposed to symbiotic, BNF, accounting for at least a third of all BNF.

	abstract = {1 Many insects derive nutritional advantage from persistent associations with microorganisms that variously synthesize essential nutrients or digest and detoxify ingested food. These persistent relationships are symbioses. 2 There is strong experimental evidence that symbiotic microorganisms provide plant sap-feeding insects with essential amino acids and contribute to the digestion of cellulose in some wood-feeding insects, including lower termites. Basic nutritional information is, however, lacking for many associations, including the relative roles of microbial and intrinsic sources of cellulose degradation in many insects and B-vitamin provisioning by microorganisms in blood-feeding insects. 3 Some nutritional interactions between insects and their symbiotic microorganisms vary among conspecifics and closely related species. This variation can, in principle, contribute to nutritional explanations for variation in the abundance and distribution of insects. For example, the plant utilization traits of phloem-feeding aphids and stinkbugs have been demonstrated to depend on the identity of microbial partners. Evidence that associations can evolve rapidly comes from the demonstration that the impact of the bacterium Wolbachia on natural populations of its insect host can change from deleterious to beneficial within two decades. 4 Developing genomic tools, especially massively parallel sequencing and metagenomic analyses, offer the opportunity to explore the metabolic capabilities of symbiotic microorganisms and their insect hosts, from which defined hypotheses of nutritional function can be constructed. Nutritional ecology provides the appropriate framework to test these hypotheses in the relevant ecological context.},

The experiment was carried out using microcosms containing a mixture of plant litter and soil in which seedlings of Lolium perenne were planted, and a range of combinations of levels of density and species richness of microarthropods added. Over the duration of the experiment, nutrient release, measured as concentrations of NO3--N and total N in leachates, increased significantly with increasing microarthropod density, but decreased with increasing species richness. Leachate concentrations of NH4+-N, dissolved organic N and C (DON and DOC) were not affected by the faunal treatments. Soil respiration, a measure of microbial activity, decreased with increasing density of microarthropods, whereas microbial biomass was not affected by microarthropods. Increasing density of soil animals had a negative effect on the shoot biomass of L. perenne while the effect of species richness was positive. Neither the species richness nor density of soil microarthropods was found to significantly influence root biomass. We conclude that variations in animal density had a greater influence on soil nutrient mineralisation processes than did species richness. Possible reasons for these opposing effects of animal density and diversity on soil N mobilization are discussed.},

Moveover, [1,3-15N]uric acid dissimilated by gut bacteria in vivo leads to assimilation of 15N into termite tissues.

Here we report the discovery of this missing lithotroph and its identification as a new, autotrophic member of the order Planctomycetales, one of the major distinct divisions of the Bacteria5. The new planctomycete grows extremely slowly, dividing only once every two weeks. At present, it cannot be cultivated by conventional microbiological techniques. The identification of this bacterium as the one responsible for anaerobic oxidation of ammonia makes an important contribution to the problem of unculturability.},

Calculations, which were used to derive thermodynamic parameters that were further used for a kinetic analysis, have been done at the solvent-corrected MP2/6-311++G** level. Both elimination and hydrolytic pathways have been considered. Elimination is favored for the solution phase reaction, which proceeds by H-bond coordination of a water molecule to the amine nitrogen atoms. The coordination of one water molecule greatly facilitates the reaction by allowing it to proceed through a cyclic six-member transition state. Aspects of the water−urea H-bond interactions have also provided insights into critical aspects of the hydrogen bond pattern in the urease active site. On the basis of a kinetic analysis, we have estimated the proficiency of urease and have predicted that it is the most proficient enzyme identified to date.},

	abstract = {At the active site of urease, urea undergoes nucleophilic attack by water, whereas urea decomposes in solution by elimination of ammonia so that its rate of spontaneous hydrolysis is unknown. Quantum mechanical simulations have been interpreted as indicating that urea hydrolysis is extremely slow, compared with other biological reactions proceeding spontaneously, and that urease surpasses all other enzymes in its power to enhance the rate of a reaction. We tested that possibility experimentally by examining the hydrolysis of 1,1,3,3-tetramethylurea, from which elimination cannot occur. In neutral solution at 25 degrees C, the rate constant for the uncatalyzed hydrolysis of tetramethylurea is 4.2 x 10-12 s-1, which does not differ greatly from the rate constants observed for the uncatalyzed hydrolysis of acetamide (5.1 x 10-11 s-1) or N,N-dimethylacetamide (1.8 x 10-11 s-1) under the same conditions. We estimate that the proficiency of urease as a catalyst, (kcat/Km)/knon, is 8 x 1017 M-1, slightly higher than the values for other metalloenzymes (carboxypeptidase b and cytidine deaminase) that catalyze the hydrolysis of similar bonds.},

Nearly 3000 described species from 269 families are recorded in the country, representing a 56\% increase from the 1917 species reported by Lindquist et al. (1979). An additional 42 families are known from Canada only from material identified to family- or genus-level. Of the total 311 families known in Canada, 69 are newly recorded since 1979, excluding apparent new records due solely to classification changes. This substantial progress is most evident in Oribatida and Hydrachnidia, for which many regional checklists and family-level revisions have been published. Except for recent taxonomic leaps in a few other groups, particularly of symbiotic mites (Astigmata: feather mites; Mesostigmata: Rhinonyssidae), knowledge remains limited for most other taxa, for which most species records are unpublished and may require verification. Taxonomic revisions are greatly needed for a large majority of families in Canada. Based in part on species recorded in adjacent areas of the USA and on hosts known to be present here, we conservatively estimate that nearly 10,000 species of mites occur in Canada, but the actual number could be 15,000 or more. This means that at least 70\% of Canada’s mite fauna is yet unrecorded. Much work also remains to match existing molecular data with species names, as less than 10\% of the {\textasciitilde}7500 Barcode Index Numbers for Canadian mites in the Barcode of Life Database are associated with named species. Understudied hosts and terrestrial and aquatic habitats require investigation across Canada to uncover new species and to clarify geographic and ecological distributions of known species.},

The use of ecological, environmental and biodiversity indicators, is reviewed here. Although indicator taxa are considered to be generally unreliable as broad indicators of biodiversity, they may serve a useful function in identifying ecological characteristics or monitoring the effects of habitat management. Use of only a narrow range of taxa may be unreliable, and is particularly vulnerable to distortion by a small number of invasive species. Taxa also need to be selected to reflect the specific ecosystem being studied. It is recommended that isopods be used for soil systems (if there is sufficient local diversity), in some areas earthworms or mites may be useable but are generally too difficult to identify to be practically useful. In the ground layer indicator sets could include ants, millipedes, molluscs (snails in particular), ground beetles, harvestmen and gnaphosid spiders. Foliage-inhabiting indicators could comprise ants, chrysomelid leaf beetles, theridiid spiders and arctiid moths. Ants, orthopterans and butterflies may be appropriate for use in open habitats. These basic sets should be supplemented by other taxa where appropriate resources and taxonomic expertise are available.},

Here, we review these ecological mechanisms influencing grassland arthropod diversity. We summarize hypotheses describing species diversity at local and regional scales and then discuss specific factors that may affect arthropod diversity in grassland systems.

Fire and grazing interact in complex ways in TGP, resulting in a shifting mosaic of resource quantity and quality for primary consumers. Accordingly, the impacts of arthropod herbivores and detritivores are expected to vary spatially and temporally. Herbivores generally do not control primary production. Rather, groups such as grasshoppers have subtle effects on plant communities, and their most significant impacts are often on forbs, which represent the bulk of plant diversity in TGP. Belowground herbivores and detritivores influence root dynamics and rhizosphere nutrient cycling, and above- and belowground groups interact through plant responses and detrital pathways. Large-bodied taxa, such as cicadas, can also redistribute significant quantities of materials during adult emergences. Predatory arthropods are the least studied in terms of ecological significance, but there is evidence that top-down processes are important in TGP.},

The natural variation of the stable isotopes 15N/14N was measured in 36 species/taxa from four beech and beech-oak forests. Signatures of δ15N formed a gradient spanning over 12 δ units suggesting that (a) different species occupy different trophic niches and (b) oribatid mites span three to four trophic levels.

We found that microarthropod densities increased with elevated soil fertility, but we detected no concurrent change in the diversity of soil microarthropods (mites and Collembola combined). That microarthropod density increased concurrently with improvements in soil fertility and plant productivity suggests that soil microarthropod communities are predominately regulated by bottom-up forces, driven by increased energy transfer via plant inputs to soil, providing increased food resources for fauna. However, that we found no concurrent change in the diversity of soil microarthropods provides little support for the idea that the diversity of soil fauna is positively related to their population density, primary productivity or improvements in soil conditions resulting from nutrient manipulations. However, we did find that microarthropod communities of more fertile sites contained a greater proportion of predators suggesting that more energy was transferred to higher trophic levels under elevated soil fertility. Our findings suggest that unlike plant communities, soil faunal diversity may not be strongly regulated by competition in productive situations, since competitive exclusion might not occur due to increased predation. Whilst we conclude that soil microarthropod diversity at our study site has not been affected by the nutrient additions to date, in the longer term we predict that changes in community composition and diversity could arise, most likely through top-down regulation of the soil food web.},

In this paper, I develop and discuss methods for generating an isotopic baseline and evaluate the assumptions required to estimate the trophic position of consumers using stable isotopes in multiple ecosystem studies. I test the ability of two primary consumers, surface-grazing snails and filter-feeding mussels, to capture the spatial and temporal variation at the base of aquatic food webs. I find that snails reflect the isotopic signature of the base of the littoral food web, mussels reflect the isotopic signature of the pelagic food web, and together they provide a good isotopic baseline for estimating trophic position of secondary or higher trophic level consumers in lake ecosystems. Then, using data from 25 north temperate lakes, I evaluate how δ15N and δ13C of the base of aquatic food webs varies both among lakes and between the littoral and pelagic food webs within lakes. Using data from the literature, I show that the mean trophic fractionation of δ15N is 3.4‰ (1 sd = 1‰) and of δ13C is 0.4‰ (1 sd = 1.3‰), and that both, even though variable, are widely applicable. A sensitivity analysis reveals that estimates of trophic position are very sensitive to assumptions about the trophic fractionation of δ15N, moderately sensitive to different methods for generating an isotopic baseline, and not sensitive to assumptions about the trophic fractionation of δ13C when δ13C is used to estimate the proportion of nitrogen in a consumer derived from two sources. Finally, I compare my recommendations for generating an isotopic baseline to an alternative model proposed by M. J. Vander Zanden and J. B. Rasmussen. With an appropriate isotopic baseline and an appreciation of the underlying assumptions and model sensitivity, stable isotopes can help answer some of the most difficult questions in food web ecology.},

	abstract = {Soil systems provide numerous ecosystem services but are often degraded due to anthropogenic and natural disturbances. Invertebrates can be used as biological indicators to provide information on soil health. Mites (Arachnida: Acariformes, Parasitiformes) constitute the majority of invertebrates in soil; however, their small size and diversity make them a challenging group to identify. Identification to levels coarser than species (e.g., genus, family) can alleviate some of the taxonomic difficulties. Here we test whether two groups of soil mites, Mesostigmata and Oribatida, can indicate three disturbance types (fire, forest harvest and linear features such as seismic lines and roads) in the boreal forest in northern Alberta. We assessed this at three taxonomic levels: species, genus and family. Samples were collected by the Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute from 2010 to 2015 from across Alberta. We paired disturbed sites with nearby undisturbed sites while minimizing habitat and temporal differences (N pairs: fire = 13, harvest = 11, linear = 7). Mesostigmata were separated into two size categories, large only ({\textgreater}300 μm) and with small included (all mites {\textgreater} 50 μm), while oribatid were analyzed only with individuals {\textgreater} 300 μm. We used ANOVAs and PERMANOVAs to determine whether species richness, Shannon-Wiener diversity and assemblage structure differed significantly between disturbed and undisturbed sites. Compared to undisturbed habitats, we found that richness and diversity of Mesostigmata {\textgreater} 50 μm were lower with fire disturbance at all three taxonomic levels; similarly, richness and diversity of Oribatida were lower with fire and harvest at all three taxonomic levels and richness was lower for linear disturbance at family-level. Assemblage structure of Mesostigmata {\textgreater} 50 μm indicated fire and linear disturbance at all three taxonomic levels, while that of Mesostigmata {\textgreater} 300 μm indicated all three-disturbance types at species-level, and harvest disturbance at genus and family. Assemblage structure of Oribatida indicated fire disturbance at all three taxonomic levels, and linear disturbance at genus and family. Our analyses showed that mesostigmatid and oribatid mites can indicate disturbance when identified to ranks coarser than species suggests that labour-intensive species-level identifications may not always be required for bioindicator studies using soil mites. The generality of these findings should be assessed in different regions and with different disturbances.},

Shannon’s diversity index was significantly higher for all natural land cover types, seismic lines, and forest harvest. Additionally, species diversity was lower under the relative influence of energy-related soft linear disturbances than for naturally vegetated sites and forest harvesting, and was lowered further by anthropogenic disturbances with more impact on soil integrity (cultivation, mines, urban/industrial, road/trail verges, well sites). Abundance, richness, and diversity also increased with increased frost free period and with eastward longitude. Mite community composition included a notable composition difference between lowland habitats and upland forest types, and between natural land cover and intense anthropogenic disturbance types (e.g., mines, cultivation). Our study highlighted oribatid mite communities’ response to natural land cover, anthropogenic disturbance and spatial–climatic factors assessed over broad spatial scales and the potential utility of oribatid mites as ecosystem health indicators under multiple ecological drivers.},

Calcite (calcium carbonate) is the mineral deposited by mites representating the Ptyctima, but three species of Enarthronota (Eniochthonius minutissimus, Archoplophora rostralis, and Prototritia major) deposit whewellite, a form of calcium oxalate. The latter is deposited even in individuals living in base-poor environments such as sphagnum bogs, and probably derives from crystals originally precipitated by the fungal food of these mites. Our observations provide the first strong evidence of cuticular hardening by mineralization in the Arachnida, and the only known instance of the use of whewellite as a general intracuticular hardening agent in arthropods. A brief survey of representative oribatid mites, examined for strong birefringence under polarized light, suggested that each of the three ptychoid lineages (Ptyctima, Mesoplophoridae, Protoplophoridae) evolved cuticular mineralization independently.},

One possible indicator of environmental stress at individual level is structural malformations of exoskeleton. We studied whether a number of leg deformities in soil oribatid mites could be used as an indicator of the degree of heavy metal pollution or acidity in nature. For this purpose we collected soil samples in a well known pollution gradient of a Finnish Cu-Ni smelter. Heavy metals are common pollutants in the area. Ten focal oribatid species were inspected under microscope for deformations in their legs (missing, broken or deformed leg). Of the focal species only one (Chamobates cuspidatus) showed an increasing trend along the pollution gradient in the proportion of leg abnormalities but there were clear differences in proportions among species. We consider that leg deformities are not a good indicator of heavy metal exposure in the studied species. Our data suggest, however, that they may indicate spatial variation in soil pH. We also tested for the possible effects of pollution on oribatid species number and abundances. There were pollution-related differences in relative abundances of mites but not in the number of species. We discuss the relationship between soil pH, calcium requirements and skeletal malformations of oribatid mites.},

	abstract = {Restoration needs to consider more than just soils and plants. The role of terrestrial invertebrates in the restoration of Alcoa’s bauxite mines in the Jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) forest of Western Australia has been the subject of over 20 individual studies. Projects range from arthropods in soil and leaf litter, to the understorey vegetation, and the tree canopy. Moreover, projects span a range of trophic groups, including decomposers (e.g., springtails and termites), predators (e.g., ants and spiders), and herbivores (e.g., true bugs and ants preying on seeds). Elucidation of recolonization trajectories uses both space-for-time substitutions and long-term regular sampling. Importantly, many studies are at species level rather than coarser taxonomic ranks. This paper provides an historical account and an integrated review of this research. The role of ants as seed predators and as indicators of ecosystem health is described. Successional data for other groups, when measured by species richness (ants, spiders, and hemipterans) and composition (ants and spiders), show their reassembly trajectories tracking toward unmined reference areas. Hemipteran species composition tracks the vegetation reassembly trajectory but not toward unmined reference areas. Studies also have revealed optimal sampling methods for surveying invertebrates and their rich biodiversity in southwestern Australia. In restored mine pits burnt to reduce fuel loads, the response of spiders to this additional disturbance was retrogression/alteration of the post-mining trajectory. Finally, attention is drawn to research areas receiving limited scrutiny to date, such as the contribution of terrestrial invertebrates to ecosystem function and taxonomic groups not yet studied.},

Mite (Acari) communities and soil quality characteristics were used to evaluate soil ecosystem development on four tailings sites, 0, 8, 20 and 40 years post rehabilitation in comparison with that on four control sites. Abundance, species richness, diversity (H′) and community structure of soil mites were sensitive indicators of tailings rehabilitation and soil formation. Mite density on older and botanically diverse tailings sites was comparable to that on control sites; however, species richness of oribatids and mesostigmatics was lower than on control sites. Mite species richness and diversity on tailings were lower at less botanically diverse sites regardless of age. Similarity of tailings-mite communities to control-site communities generally increased with age; however, similarities were all less than 60\% (Sorenson's quantitative index, CN). Mite assemblages on tailings were dominated by a few colonizing species, whereas control sites had a diverse assemblage of species. Soil pH and organic matter (SOM) of rehabilitated tailings improved with age and degree of botanical complexity. Mite density and diversity was positively related to SOM particularily for the Oribatida. SOM and mites were mainly restricted to the 0–5-cm horizon.},

Organisms with generalist diets are more flexible in their feeding habits than are specialists, and may be affected less in a changing environment. Soil fauna fulfill crucial ecosystem functions in terrestrial ecosystems and many are thought to have generalized diets. They may therefore be buffered from negative effects of environmental change. Here, we used 15N isotope analysis to study trophic differentiation among 91 species of oribatid mites and their responses to chronic atmospheric N deposition. Combining our own measurements with published data, we established that the trophic positions of mite species were remarkably stable within and among forests, as well as between ambient and experimental N deposition. Trophic stability indicates a higher than expected level of feeding specialization, which may foster diversity, but limit the ability to switch food resources in a changing environment.},

Our aims are (a) to recapitulate the history of stable isotope research in soil animals with a focus on oribatid mites, (b) to present new stable isotope data for oribatid mites and overview the current state of knowledge of oribatid mite trophic niche differentiation, (c) to compile problems and limitations of stable isotope based analyses of trophic relationships and (d) to suggest future challenges, questions and problems that may be solved using stable isotope analyses and other novel techniques for improving our understanding on the trophic ecology of soil invertebrates. We conclude that (1) in addition to 15N/14N ratios, 13C/12C ratios contribute to our understanding of the trophic ecology of oribatid mites, allowing, e.g. separation of lichen- and moss-feeding species, (2) there likely are many lichen but few moss feeding oribatid mite species, (3) oribatid mite species that are endophagous as juveniles are separated by their stable isotope signatures from all other oribatid mite species, (4) fungivorous oribatid mite species cannot be separated further, e.g. the fungal taxa they feed on cannot be delineated. A particular problem in using stable isotope data is the difficulty in determining signatures for basal food resources, since decomposing material, fungi and lichens comprise various components differing in stable isotope signatures; 13C/12C ratios and potentially other isotopes may help in identifying the role of these resources for decomposer animal nutrition.},

	abstract = {Animals reflect the stable isotope ratios (δ15N and δ13C) of their diet, with a slight enrichment in 15N that allows the use of δ15N as a trophic-level indicator. Stable isotope contents were measured for the litter, soil, and macro-invertebrates of three temperate deciduous forest sites, in spring, summer, and autumn, to study the trophic structure of this community. No distinct trophic structure could be derived from measurements of δ13C. In contrast, when the δ15N values of all animal species were grouped together, the hypothesis of an isotopically similar diet was rejected. Therefore, the community spreads over more than one trophic level and was subdivided into detritivores and predators. The potential detritivore food sources in the forest litter and soil showed a variety of isotopic ratios. Despite this fact, the variance of the isotopic ratios of the detritivorous species was not larger than what could be expected from interspecific variability of trophic isotopic enrichment alone. This was also the case for the predators in most of the sample sets. However, in some cases this variance was significantly larger, due to a small number of species with high δ15N values. The δ15N values of the detritivores indicated that the mean δ15N value of their food was close to that measured for the superficial litter layers. The difference in δ15N between detritivores and predators was highly significant and never significantly different from the value expected for one trophic transfer (3.4‰), although often slightly higher. Most of the litter macro-invertebrate community we studied can therefore be described as belonging to two trophic levels, one feeding on the superficial litter layers (or on soil fractions that have a similar δ15N value), and a second trophic level feeding on the first, with some indication of intraguild predation among the predators. Between-site differences of up to 7‰ were found for δ15N in the litter, and the δ15N values of the whole animal community were shifted in accordance with the local value of the litter δ15N. Therefore, the trophic structure must be studied in relation to the local isotopic content of the litter. Seasonal differences in isotopic ratios of the litter or animal samples were neither large nor consistent. These findings indicate similar trophic structure of the communities at the three sites and during the three sampling periods.},

	abstract = {The influence of diet on the distribution of nitrogen isotopes in animals was investigated by analyzing animals grown in the laboratory on diets of constant nitrogen isotopic composition. The isotopic composition of the nitrogen in an animal reflects the nitrogen isotopic composition of its diet. The δ15N values of the whole bodies of animals are usually more positive than those of their diets. Different individuals of a species raised on the same diet can have significantly different δ15N values. The variability of the relationship between the δ15N values of animals and their diets is greater for different species raised on the same diet than for the same species raised on different diets. Different tissues of mice are also enriched in 15N relative to the diet, with the difference between the δ15N values of a tissue and the diet depending on both the kind of tissue and the diet involved. The δ15N values ofcollagen and chitin. biochemical components that are often preserved in fossil animal remains, are also related to the δ15N value of the diet. The dependence of the δ15N values of whole animals and their tissues and biochemical components on the δ15N value of diet indicates that the isotopic composition of animal nitrogen can be used to obtain information about an animal's diet if its potential food sources had different δ15N values. The nitrogen isotopic method of dietary analysis probably can be used to estimate the relative use of legumes vs non-legumes or of aquatic vs terrestrial organisms as food sources for extant and fossil animals. However, the method probably will not be applicable in those modern ecosystems in which the use of chemical fertilizers has influenced the distribution of nitrogen isotopes in food sources. The isotopic method of dietary analysis was used to reconstruct changes in the diet of the human population that occupied the Tehuacan Valley of Mexico over a 7000 yr span. Variations in the δ15C and δ15N values of bone collagen suggest that C4 and/or CAM plants (presumably mostly corn) and legumes (presumably mostly beans) were introduced into the diet much earlier than suggested by conventional archaeological analysis.},

	abstract = {Animals usually show a δ15N value that is slightly higher than that of their food. The value of this enrichment appears to be fairly constant among species (approximately 3‰). This phenomenon is more and more widely used in ecological research to study individual diets or the trophic structure of whole communities. However, very little is known about the mechanisms that actually explain how this trophic isotopic enrichment occurs. Most ideas about these mechanisms are only expressed verbally, so that it is difficult to get a clear picture of what is actually known, and how these pieces of knowledge interact. We propose a very simple model that describes mathematically what is currently known on the trophic isotopic enrichment phenomenon in animals. This model cannot replace actual measurements and investigations about the mechanisms explaining the phenomenon. However, it allows the clarification of some ideas such as what conditions have to be fulfilled in order for the trophic isotopic enrichment to occur. Our formalisation accounts for all the known features of the trophic isotopic enrichment phenomenon that we consider in this paper in both a qualitative and quantitative manner (at least for orders of magnitude). A prediction of the theory, that can be tested, is that growing animals should show the same δ15N values as those of adults fed the same diet if the total amount of nitrogen they assimilate during their growth is large compared to the total nitrogen content of their adult body. It seems likely that this condition is fulfilled in most cases. Copyright © 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

It is the first combustion method that allows direct measurement of isotope ratios of individual molecular components of mixtures. Unlike traditional gas isotope ratio measurements made on pure samples, the method requires only very small samples, viz. several picolitres of the vapour. This paper reviews the principles and history of gas isotope ratio monitoring, focusing on the instrumentation used in isotope ratio monitoring GC/MS, including the combustion procedures used for atomization.

We measured the natural variation in stable isotope ratios (15N/14N, 13C/12C) in oribatid mites from the bark of oak (Quercus robur), beech (Fagus sylvatica), spruce (Picea abies) and pine (Pinus sylvestris) trees and their potential food sources, i.e., the covering vegetation of the bark (bryophytes, lichens, algae, fungi). As a baseline for calibration the stable isotope signatures of the bark of the four tree species were measured and set to zero. Oribatid mite stable isotope ratios spanned over a range of about 13 δ units for 15N and about 7 δ units for 13C suggesting that they span over about three trophic levels. Different stable isotope signatures indicate that bark living oribatid mites feed on different food sources, i.e., occupy distinct trophic niches. After calibration stable isotope signatures of respective oribatid mite species of the four tree species were similar indicating close association of oribatid mites with the corticolous cover as food source. Overall, the results support the hypothesis that trophic niche differentiation of bark living oribatid mites contributes to the high diversity of the group.},

We hypothesized that community structure and trophic position of oribatid mites of dry grassland soils and bark of trees are similar since these habitats have similar abiotic characteristics (open, dry) compared with forest soil. Further, we hypothesized that derived taxa of oribatid mites reproducing sexually dominate on the bark of trees since species in this habitat consume living resources such as lichens. In contrast to our hypothesis, the community structure of oribatid mites differed among grassland, forest and bark indicating the existence of niche differentiation in the respective oribatid mite species. In agreement with our hypothesis, sexually reproducing taxa of oribatid mites dominated on the bark of trees whereas parthenogenetic species were more frequent in soil. Several species of bark-living oribatid mites had stable isotope signatures that were similar to lichens indicating that they feed on lichens. However, nine species that frequently occurred on tree bark did not feed on lichens according to their stable isotope signatures. No oribatid mite species could be ascribed to moss feeding. We conclude that sexual reproduction served as preadaptation for oribatid mites allowing them to exploit new habitats and new resources on the bark of trees. Abiotic factors likely are of limited importance for bark-living oribatid mites since harsh abiotic conditions are assumed to favor parthenogenesis.},

Analysis of stable isotope ratios of N and C provides a powerful tool for disentangling food web structure. In this study, animals, roots, soil and litter material from a temperate deciduous forest were analysed. The combined measurement of δ15N and δ13C provided insights into the compartmentalization of the soil animal food web. Leaf litter feeders were separated from animals relying mainly on recent belowground carbon resources and from animals feeding on older carbon. The trophic pathway of leaf litter-feeding species appears to be a dead end, presumably because leaf litter feeders (mainly diplopods and oribatid mites) are unavailable to predators due to large size and/or strong sclerotization. Endogeic earthworms that rely on older carbon also appear to exist in predator-free space. The data suggest that the largest trophic compartment constitutes of ectomycorrhizal feeders and their predators. Additionally, there is a smaller trophic compartment consisting of predators likely feeding on enchytraeids and potentially nematodes.},

Isotope ratios of C (δ13C) and N (δ15N) were measured in herbivorous and detritivorous invertebrate groups, namely lumbricid earthworms (7 species), enchytraeid worms (3 species), slugs (3 taxa), and their potential food sources in an arable system. Intrapopulation δ15N variation in the slug Deroceras reticulatum (n=52) was large (range 4.2‰), possibly reflecting spatial variability in the food sources. Significant correlations between C:N ratios and isotope ratios in earthworms suggest that factors other than feeding may influence isotopic patterns. One enchytraeid species, Enchytraeus buchholzi, was enriched in 13C and strongly depleted in 15N compared to all other groups. Invertebrates formed a continuum when considered in relation to C and N separately, but fell into two distinct groups on the basis of combined C and N isotope ratios. The less enriched group represents herbivorous and litter-feeding species, while the more enriched group represents soil feeders. It is concluded that δ13C measurements could provide a means of assigning separate baseline δ15N values to primary and secondary decomposers, which in turn could improve the inference of higher trophic levels, omnivory and intraguild predation.},

	abstract = {The structure of the soil food web in two beech (Fagus sylvatica) forests, the Göttinger Wald and the Solling forest (Northern Germany), was investigated using variations in tissue 15N concentrations of animal species or taxa. The Göttinger Wald is located on a limestone plateau and characterized by mull humus with high macrofauna activity, particularly of Lumbricidae, Diplopoda and Isopoda. In contrast, the Solling forest is located on a sandstone mountain range and characterized by moder humus. The soil fauna of this forest is dominated by mesofauna, particularly by Collembola, Enchytraeidae and Oribatida. In June 1995 soil fauna was sampled using heat extraction. Three soil layers were analysed at each of the sites. 15N/14N ratios of bulk material increased strongly with soil depth in both forests. This also applied to the water-soluble fraction at the Göttinger Wald, but not at the Solling. Generally, the water-soluble fraction was more enriched in 15N than the bulk materials. For most animals studied 15N/14N ratios varied little with soil depth. In both forests soil animals could be classified either as saprophages, including microphytophages, or predators. On average, the δ15N of predatory taxa (Chilopoda, Araneida, Gamasina, Staphylinidae) exceeded that of saprophagous or microphytophagous taxa (Lumbricidae, Isopoda, Diplopoda, Collembola, Oribatida, Enchytraeidae) by 4.4 and 3.9‰ for the Göttinger Wald and the Solling, respectively. We assume that most of the saprophagous or microphytophagous taxa studied consist of primary and secondary decomposers and hypothesize that predators prey more on secondary than primary decomposers. Generally, average δ15N values differed little between saprophagous (Lumbricidae, Diplopoda, Isopoda) and microphytophagous taxa (Collembola, Oribatida). The variations in δ15N values of species within these taxa consistently exceeded the variation between them, indicating that the species of each of these taxa form a continuum from primary to secondary decomposers. Also, variations in δ15N values within predatory taxa in most cases exceeded that between taxa excluding top predators like Sorex. We conclude that using higher taxonomic units in soil food web analysis is problematic and in general not consistent with nature. Higher taxonomic units may only be useful for depicting very general trophic groupings such as predators or microbi-detritivores.},

	abstract = {Nematodes of different trophic groups control distinct energy channels, though their exact trophic links remain little understood. Molecular data suggest that soil nematodes are readily consumed by a wide range of other soil animals, but the significance of these interactions remains unknown. We used stable isotope analysis to gain a better understanding of the trophic niches of soil nematodes in a boreal forest. We tested four taxonomic groups, Mononchida, Dorylaimida, Plectidae and Tylenchidae (mostly from the genus Filenchus), representing predators, omnivores, bacterivores and root-fungal feeders, respectively. To assess the trophic position of nematodes, we used a set of reference species including herbivorous, saprophagous and predatory macro-invertebrates, oribatid and mesostigmatid mites, and collembolans. The trophic positions of the investigated groups of soil nematodes generally agree with common knowledge. All nematodes were enriched in 13C relative to Picea abies roots and litter, as well as to fungal mycelium analyzed. Root-fungal feeders Tylenchidae had δ15N values similar to those of earthworms, enchytraeids and Entomobrya collembolans. In contrast, bacterivorous Plectidae were enriched in 15N compared to saprophagous macroinvertebrates and most mesofauna species. Omnivorous Dorylaimida and predatory Mononchida were further enriched in 15N and their isotopic signature was very similar to that of predatory arthropods. These data confirm a clear separation of nematodes into microbial feeders (Tylenchidae and Plectidae) and predators (Mononchida and Dorylaimida). They also suggest that the trophic position of soil animals is largely independent of their body size, the smallest soil predators like nematodes occupying the same trophic level as predatory macro-invertebrates. Our data failed to confirm that bacterivorous or predatory soil nematodes are important prey for oribatid mites or collembolans. The patterns of isotopic signatures indicate that soil nematodes and the bulk of soil animals depend on resources derived from a dominating upper-canopy tree (P. abies) via the detrital rather than mycorrhizal pathway. Herbaceous plants and dwarf shrubs do not contribute significantly to the energy budget of soil communities in the boreal forest studied.},

	abstract = {Soil organisms drive major ecosystem functions by mineralising carbon and releasing nutrients during decomposition processes, which supports plant growth, aboveground biodiversity and, ultimately, human nutrition. Soil ecologists often operate with functional groups to infer the effects of individual taxa on ecosystem functions and services. Simultaneous assessment of the functional roles of multiple taxa is possible using food-web reconstructions, but our knowledge of the feeding habits of many taxa is insufficient and often based on limited evidence. Over the last two decades, molecular, biochemical and isotopic tools have improved our understanding of the feeding habits of various soil organisms, yet this knowledge is still to be synthesised into a common functional framework. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the feeding habits of consumers in soil, including protists, micro-, meso- and macrofauna (invertebrates), and soil-associated vertebrates. We have integrated existing functional group classifications with findings gained with novel methods and compiled an overarching classification across taxa focusing on key universal traits such as food resource preferences, body masses, microhabitat specialisation, protection and hunting mechanisms. Our summary highlights various strands of evidence that many functional groups commonly used in soil ecology and food-web models are feeding on multiple types of food resources. In many cases, omnivory is observed down to the species level of taxonomic resolution, challenging realism of traditional soil food-web models based on distinct resource-based energy channels. Novel methods, such as stable isotope, fatty acid and DNA gut content analyses, have revealed previously hidden facets of trophic relationships of soil consumers, such as food assimilation, multichannel feeding across trophic levels, hidden trophic niche differentiation and the importance of alternative food/prey, as well as energy transfers across ecosystem compartments. Wider adoption of such tools and the development of open interoperable platforms that assemble morphological, ecological and trophic data as traits of soil taxa will enable the refinement and expansion of the multifunctional classification of consumers in soil. The compiled multifunctional classification of soil-associated consumers will serve as a reference for ecologists working with biodiversity changes and biodiversity–ecosystem functioning relationships, making soil food-web research more accessible and reproducible.},

However, estimating R2 for generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) remains challenging. We have previously introduced a version of R2 that we called  for Poisson and binomial GLMMs, but not for other distributional families. Similarly, we earlier discussed how to estimate intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) using Poisson and binomial GLMMs. In this paper, we generalize our methods to all other non-Gaussian distributions, in particular to negative binomial and gamma distributions that are commonly used for modelling biological data. While expanding our approach, we highlight two useful concepts for biologists, Jensen's inequality and the delta method, both of which help us in understanding the properties of GLMMs. Jensen's inequality has important implications for biologically meaningful interpretation of GLMMs, whereas the delta method allows a general derivation of variance associated with non-Gaussian distributions. We also discuss some special considerations for binomial GLMMs with binary or proportion data. We illustrate the implementation of our extension by worked examples from the field of ecology and evolution in the R environment. However, our method can be used across disciplines and regardless of statistical environments.},

It can be seen as the fixed-effects complement to the repeatability R (intra-class correlation) for the variance explained by random effects and thus as a tool for variance decomposition. The R2 of a model can be further partitioned into the variance explained by a particular predictor or a combination of predictors using semi-partial (part) R2 and structure coefficients, but this is rarely done due to a lack of software implementing these statistics. Here, we introduce partR2, an R package that quantifies part R2 for fixed effect predictors based on (generalized) linear mixed-effect model fits. The package iteratively removes predictors of interest from the model and monitors the change in the variance of the linear predictor. The difference to the full model gives a measure of the amount of variance explained uniquely by a particular predictor or a set of predictors. partR2 also estimates structure coefficients as the correlation between a predictor and fitted values, which provide an estimate of the total contribution of a fixed effect to the overall prediction, independent of other predictors. Structure coefficients can be converted to the total variance explained by a predictor, here called ‘inclusive’ R2, as the square of the structure coefficients times total R2. Furthermore, the package reports beta weights (standardized regression coefficients). Finally, partR2 implements parametric bootstrapping to quantify confidence intervals for each estimate. We illustrate the use of partR2 with real example datasets for Gaussian and binomial GLMMs and discuss interactions, which pose a specific challenge for partitioning the explained variance among predictors.},

In the classical attempt to understand the processes supporting biodiversity, ecologists are currently seeking to unravel the differential roles of environmental filtering and competition for resources in niche partitioning processes: these processes are in principle distinct although they may act simultaneously, interact at multiple spatial and temporal scales, and are often confounded in studies of soil communities. We used a novel combination of methods based on stable isotopes and trait analysis to resolve these processes in diverse oribatid mite assemblages at spatial scales at which competition for resources could in principle be a major driver. We also used a null model approach based on a general neutral model of beta diversity. A large and significant fraction of community variation was explainable in terms of linear and periodic spatial structures in the distribution of organic C, N and soil structure: species were clearly arranged along an environmental, spatially structured gradient. However, competition related trait differences did not map onto the distances separating species along the environmental gradient and neutral models provided a satisfying approximation of beta diversity patterns. The results represent the first robust evidence that in very diverse soil arthropod assemblages resource-based niche partitioning plays a minor role while environmental filtering remains a fundamental driver of species distribution.},

	abstract = {In boreal forest ecosystems, thick forest floors are a key habitat for microorganisms, micro- and mesofauna that drive soil biochemical processes. While they are the least abundant of soil mesofauna, mesostigmatan mites play a central role in soils by regulating population dynamics of other meso- and microfauna and by affecting nitrogen mineralization rates. The most abundant and diverse oribatid mites are especially important for decomposition processes in boreal forests. In this study, we evaluated the trophic ecology of mesostigmatan and oribatid mites from Canadian boreal forests by using body δ15N signatures as indicators of their trophic position. We extracted mites from the forest floors of control and clearcut stands from coniferous and deciduous stands dominated by white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss), and trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), respectively. The mite values spanned 10.2 δ units in 15N, and were enriched by at least 1.2‰ compared to forest floor (baseline) values. When compiled to known eating habits from published feeding experiments, isotopic values placed the mites in three main trophic guilds, including detritivorous, omnivorous (overlapping with predators), and predator mites. Isotopic nitrogen fractionation within the mites did not seem to be affected by their habitat (spruce vs. aspen), or clearcutting practices. Instead, in this boreal forest environment, the well-defined degree of isotopic fractionation within the food web may be solely dependent on the mite feeding relationships.},

	abstract = {A 6-year study was conducted in tallgrass prairie to assess the effects of grazing management (cattle stocking densities and grazing systems) on plant community composition and diversity. Treatments included sites grazed season-long (May to October) at 3 stocking densities (3.8, 2.8, and 1.8 hectares per animal unit), ungrazed control sites, and sites under a late-season rest rotation grazing system at this same range of stocking densities. Plant communities were sampled twice each season using a nearest-point procedure. Native plant species diversity, species richness, and growth form diversity were significantly higher in grazed compared to ungrazed prairie, and diversity was greatest at the highest stocking density. This enhancement of plant species diversity under grazing was not a result of increased frequency of weedy/exotic species. There were no significant effects of grazing system on plant diversity, nor any significant stocking density × grazing system interactions, indicating that animal density is a key management variable influencing plant species diversity and composition in tallgrass prairie and that effects of animal density override effects of grazing systems. Increasing cattle stocking densities decreased the abundance of the dominant perennial tall grasses, and increased abundance of the C4 perennial mid-grasses. The frequency of perennial forbs was relatively stable across grazing treatments. Abundance of annual forbs varied among years and grazing treatments. In half of the years sampled, annual forbs showed the highest frequency under intermediate stocking density. Patterns of responses among plant groups suggest that some species may respond principally to direct effects of grazers and others may respond to indirect effects of grazers on competitive relationships or on the spatial patterns of fuel loads and fires. Thus, this study suggests that large grazer densities, fire, and annual climatic variability interact to influence patterns of plant community composition and diversity in tallgrass prairie. Effects of varying management such as stocking densities and grazing systems on plant species diversity and the relative abundances of different plant growth forms or functional groups may have important consequences for grassland community stability and ecosystem function.},

The objective was to study effects of bison grazing on plant species composition and diversity components (plant species richness, equitability, and spatial heterogeneity) in sites of contrasting fire frequency. Cover and frequency of cool-season graminoids (e.g. Poa pratensis L., Agropyron smithii Rydb., Carex spp.) and some fortes (e.g. Aster ericoides [A. Gray] Howell, and Oxalis stricta L.) were consistently higher in sites grazed by bison than in ungrazed exclosures, whereas the dominant warm-season grasses (Andropogon gerardii Vitman, Sorghastrum nutans [L.] Nash, Panicum virgatum L., Schizachyrium scoparium [Michx.] Nash) and other forbs (e.g. Solidago missouriensis Nutt.) decreased in response to bison. Plant species diversity (H') and spatial heterogeneity in all areas sampled were significantly increased by bison. Increased heterogeneity and mean species richness in grazed prairie (40 species per sample site) compared to ungrazed prairie (29 species per site) were likely a result of greater microsite diversity generated by bison, whereas preferential grazing of the dominant grasses and concomitant increases in subordinate species resulted in an increase in equitability of species abundances. Species/area relationships indicated greater effects of bison on plant species richness with increasing sample area. Increases in plant diversity components associated with bison grazing were generally greater in annually burned than in 4-year burned sites. Effects of ungulate grazers on floristic diversity have important implications given recent evidence that plant species diversity and the compositional and production stability of grassland plant communities are positively related.},

	abstract = {Benzoxazinoids (BXs), such as 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one (DIMBOA), are secondary metabolites in grasses. The first step in BX biosynthesis converts indole-3-glycerol phosphate into indole. In maize (Zea mays), this reaction is catalyzed by either BENZOXAZINELESS1 (BX1) or INDOLE GLYCEROL PHOSPHATE LYASE (IGL). The Bx1 gene is under developmental control and is mainly responsible for BX production, whereas the Igl gene is inducible by stress signals, such as wounding, herbivory, or jasmonates. To determine the role of BXs in defense against aphids and fungi, we compared basal resistance between Bx1 wild-type and bx1 mutant lines in the igl mutant background, thereby preventing BX production from IGL. Compared to Bx1 wild-type plants, BX-deficient bx1 mutant plants allowed better development of the cereal aphid Rhopalosiphum padi, and were affected in penetration resistance against the fungus Setosphaeria turtica. At stages preceding major tissue disruption, R. padi and S. turtica elicited increased accumulation of DIMBOA-glucoside, DIMBOA, and 2-hydroxy-4,7-dimethoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one-glucoside (HDMBOA-glc), which was most pronounced in apoplastic leaf extracts. Treatment with the defense elicitor chitosan similarly enhanced apoplastic accumulation of DIMBOA and HDMBOA-glc, but repressed transcription of genes controlling BX biosynthesis downstream of BX1. This repression was also obtained after treatment with the BX precursor indole and DIMBOA, but not with HDMBOA-glc. Furthermore, BX-deficient bx1 mutant lines deposited less chitosan-induced callose than Bx1 wild-type lines, whereas apoplast infiltration with DIMBOA, but not HDMBOA-glc, mimicked chitosan-induced callose. Hence, DIMBOA functions as a defense regulatory signal in maize innate immunity, which acts in addition to its well-characterized activity as a biocidal defense metabolite.},

The hydrolytic lability of HDMBOA creates a steady-state zone of inhibition circumscribing the young maize seedling. We now show that rather than the HDMBOA natural product, an o-imidoquinone decomposition intermediate, (3Z)-2,2-dihydroxy-N-(4-methoxy-6-oxocyclohexa-2,4-dienylidene)acetamide, can function as an inhibitor of virulence gene expression in A. tumefaciens. Structural characterization of this o-imidoquinone intermediate clarifies several issues related to the decomposition pathways available to this class of antibiotics. Of direct ecological importance, this species is produced rapidly and quantitatively within the more neutral pH ranges of the A. tumefaciens cytoplasm, while HDMBOA is more persistent at the slightly acidic pH common to many soils. These results suggest the rather intriguing possibility that the physical instability of the benzoxazinone antibiotics may not only create a steady-state local defense, but also enable a "pro-drug" strategy directed against bacterial environmental sensing.},

Organic acids with Al-chelating ability play an important role in the detoxification of Al both externally and internally. Al is detoxified externally by the secretion of organic acids such as citric, oxalic, and/or malic acids from the roots. The secretion of organic acids is highly specific to Al and the site of secretion is localized to the root apex. The kind of organic acids secreted as well as secretion pattern differ among plant species. There are two patterns of Al-induced secretion of organic acids: In pattern I, there is no discernible delay between the addition of Al and the onset of the release of organic acids. Activation of the anion channel seems to be involved in this pattern; In pattern II, there is a marked lag phase between the addition of Al and the onset of organic acid release. The action of genes related to the metabolism and secretion of organic acids seems to be involved in this pattern. Internal detoxification of Al in Al-accumulating plants is achieved by the formation of Al-organic acid complex. For instance, the complex of Al-citrate (1:1) in hydrangea and Al-oxalate (1:3) in buckwheat has been identified.},

Understanding the physiological mechanisms relating to plant Al and P interactions should help facilitate the development of more Al-tolerant and/or P-efficient crops. In this study, both homogeneous and heterogeneous nutrient solution experiments were conducted to study the effects of Al and P interactions on soybean root growth and root organic acid exudation. In the homogenous solution experiments with a uniform Al and P distribution in the bulk solution, P addition significantly increased Al tolerance in four soybean genotypes differing in P efficiency. The two P-efficient genotypes appeared to be more Al tolerant than the two P-inefficient genotypes under these high-P conditions. Analysis of root exudates indicated Al toxicity induced citrate exudation, P deficiency triggered oxalate exudation, and malate release was induced by both treatments. To more closely mimic low-P acid soils where P deficiency and Al toxicity are often much greater in the lower soil horizons, a divided root chamber/nutrient solution approach was employed to impose elevated P conditions in the simulated upper soil horizon, and Al toxicity/P deficiency in the lower horizon. Under these conditions, we found that the two P-efficient genotypes were more Al tolerant during the early stages of the experiment than the P-inefficient lines. Although the same three organic acids were exuded by roots in the divided chamber experiments, their exudation patterns were different from those in the homogeneous solution system. The two P-efficient genotypes secreted more malate from the taproot tip, suggesting that improved P nutrition may enhance exudation of organic acids in the root regions dealing with the greatest Al toxicity, thus enhancing Al tolerance. These findings demonstrate that P efficiency may play a role in Al tolerance in soybean. Phosphorus-efficient genotypes may be able to enhance Al tolerance not only through direct Al-P interactions but also through indirect interactions associated with stimulated exudation of different Al-chelating organic acids in specific roots and root regions.},

The enhanced Al tolerance exhibited by some cultivars of wheat is associated with the Al-dependent efflux of malate from root apices. Malate forms a stable complex with Al that is harmless to plants and, therefore, this efflux of malate forms the basis of a hypothesis to explain Al tolerance in wheat. Here, we report on the cloning of a wheat gene, ALMT1 (aluminum-activated malate transporter), that co-segregates with Al tolerance in F2 and F3 populations derived from crosses between near-isogenic wheat lines that differ in Al tolerance. The ALMT1 gene encodes a membrane protein, which is constitutively expressed in the root apices of the Al-tolerant line at greater levels than in the near-isogenic but Al-sensitive line. Heterologous expression of ALMT1 in Xenopus oocytes, rice and cultured tobacco cells conferred an Al-activated malate efflux. Additionally, ALMT1 increased the tolerance of tobacco cells to Al treatment. These findings demonstrate that ALMT1 encodes an Al-activated malate transporter that is capable of conferring Al tolerance to plant cells.},

Physiological analysis of a transferred DNA knockout mutant for AtALMT1 as well as electrophysiological examination of the protein expressed in Xenopus oocytes showed that AtALMT1 is critical for Arabidopsis Al tolerance and encodes the Al-activated root malate efflux transporter associated with tolerance. However, gene expression and sequence analysis of AtALMT1 alleles from tolerant Columbia (Col), sensitive Landsberg erecta (Ler), and other ecotypes that varied in Al tolerance suggested that variation observed at AtALMT1 is not correlated with the differences observed in Al tolerance among these ecotypes. Genetic complementation experiments indicated that the Ler allele of AtALMT1 is equally effective as the Col allele in conferring Al tolerance and Al-activated malate release. Finally, fine-scale mapping of a quantitative trait locus (QTL) for Al tolerance on chromosome 1 indicated that AtALMT1 is located proximal to this QTL. These results indicate that AtALMT1 is an essential factor for Al tolerance in Arabidopsis but does not represent the major Al tolerance QTL also found on chromosome 1.},

	abstract = {Aluminum-activated root malate and citrate exudation play an important role in plant Al tolerance. This paper characterizes AtMATE, a homolog of the recently discovered sorghum and barley Al-tolerance genes, shown here to encode an Al-activated citrate transporter in Arabidopsis. Together with the previously characterized Al-activated malate transporter, AtALMT1, this discovery allowed us to examine the relationship in the same species between members of the two gene families for which Al-tolerance genes have been identified. AtMATE is expressed primarily in roots and is induced by Al. An AtMATE T-DNA knockdown line exhibited very low AtMATE expression and Al-activated root citrate exudation was abolished. The AtALMT1 AtMATE double mutant lacked both Al-activated root malate and citrate exudation and showed greater Al sensitivity than the AtALMT1 mutant. Therefore, although AtALMT1 is a major contributor to Arabidopsis Al tolerance, AtMATE also makes a significant but smaller contribution. The expression patterns of AtALMT1 and AtMATE and the profiles of Al-activated root citrate and malate exudation are not affected by the presence or absence of the other gene. These results suggest that AtALMT1-mediated malate exudation and AtMATE-mediated citrate exudation evolved independently to confer Al tolerance in Arabidopsis. However, a link between regulation of expression of the two transporters in response to Al was identified through work on STOP1, a transcription factor that was previously shown to be necessary for AtALMT1 expression. Here we show that STOP1 is also required for AtMATE expression and Al-activated citrate exudation.},

	abstract = {Aluminum (Al) toxicity in acid soils is a significant limitation to crop production worldwide, as approximately 50\% of the world's potentially arable soil is acidic. Because acid soils are such an important constraint to agriculture, understanding the mechanisms and genes conferring resistance to Al toxicity has been a focus of intense research interest in the decade since the last article on crop acid soil tolerance was published in this journal. An impressive amount of progress has been made during that time that has greatly increased our understanding of the diversity of Al resistance genes and mechanisms, how resistance gene expression is regulated and triggered by Al and Al-induced signals, and how the proteins encoded by these genes function and are regulated. This review examines the state of our understanding of the physiological, genetic, and molecular bases for crop Al tolerance, looking at the novel Al resistance genes and mechanisms that have been identified over the past ten years. Additionally, it examines how the integration of molecular and genetic analyses of crop Al resistance is starting to be exploited for the improvement of crop plants grown on acid soils via both molecular-assisted breeding and biotechnology approaches.},
