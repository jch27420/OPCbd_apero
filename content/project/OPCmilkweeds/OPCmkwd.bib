	abstract = {The plant kingdom has elaborated several conducting systems. Three are primarily for mass transport: the aerenchyma (for gas exchange in submerged parts), the phloem (for exchange of nutrients within the plant), and the xylem (largely for transport of water from soil to transpiring leaves). Two others are believed to be primarily defensive and to store under pressure aversive contents which they exude when punctured: the laticifer and the secretory duct. This review provides for the latter two systems the highlights of what is known about their general physiology and ecophysiology but not their metabolism and their molecular biology. It is argued that, given the importance of laticifers and secretory ducts to plant defense against insect herbivory, these structures are under-investigated and deserve more intensive study.},

	abstract = {Latex, a sap produced by cells called laticifers, occurs in plants of wide taxonomic diversity. Plants exude latex sap in response to physical damage. Questions about the function of latex or the underlying mechanisms persist, but a role in defense is likely. The presence of constitutive peptidases in latex sap in addition to inducible and de novo synthesized pathogenesis-related proteins (PR-proteins), raises the question about the role that each sap component plays to protect plants and how synergism occurs among sap proteins in the course of herbivory or infection. Here we discuss a variety of functions for laticifer and latex in plant defense. We propose that latex peptidases build the front line of defense against herbivores or pathogens.},

While laticifers are present only in a small percentage of the flowering plant species, they represent a type of specialized tissue within the plant where a myriad of metabolites are synthesized, some of them of considerable commercial importance. In this mini-review we synopsize the present knowledge about laticifer cells and discuss about their particular features as well as some evolutionary and ecophysiological cues and the potential exploitation of the knowledge generated around this peculiar type of plant cell. We illustrate some of these questions with the experience in Euphorbia lathyris laticifers and latex.},

	doi = {10.1111/eea.12340},
	abstract = {Cardiac glycosides are a prime example of highly toxic plant secondary compounds, which block an essential transmembrane carrier in animals, the Na,K-ATPase. Nevertheless, over 100 insect species from diverse orders are known to feed on plants containing these compounds and in many cases these toxins are additionally sequestered without ill effect. We investigated whether the insects’ adaptations for handling cardiac glycosides are based on a single physiological mechanism or whether various strategies have evolved across groups. We analyzed gene sequences of the Na,K-ATPase α-subunit from cardiac glycoside-adapted insects and screened for amino-acid substitutions which could alter the affinity of the enzyme toward cardiac glycosides. In representatives from five insect orders, separated by over 300 million years of evolutionary divergence, we uncovered amino-acid substitutions at identical positions. Especially striking is the convergent substitution of a histidine for the conserved asparagine at position 122, which we report here for the first time in a sawfly, Monophadnus latus Costa (Hymenoptera: Tenthredinidae), and which was previously observed in the orders Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, Hemiptera, and Diptera. Prior in vitro expression and enzyme assays indicated that this substitution as well as combined substitutions with other residues result in a strongly increased cardenolide resistance of the Na,K-ATPase. The substitutions to threonine111 and histidine122 observed in M. latus are highly effective and were previously known only in lygaeid bugs. However, not all insects dealing with dietary cardenolides rely on target-site insensitivity as a mechanism of resistance. An impermeable gut or the exclusion of cardenolides from the nervous tissue with the greatest expression of Na,K-ATPase by the perineurium, the insect blood brain barrier, apparently represent alternative strategies. Immuno-histochemical data presented here support the existence of P-glycoprotein-like efflux transporters in insect gut membranes that might prevent the uptake of allelochemicals like cardenolides.},

The digitalis glucosides, ouabain and digitoxin, in concentrations approximating those obtaining in the body following the administration of therapeutic quantities of these drugs, bring about a several-fold increase in systolic tension. There is thus demonstrated a direct action of digitalis bodies in increasing the force of cardiac muscle, independent of any effects which might be mediated through other influences on the intact heart. Shortening of the muscle fiber (decrease in diastolic size) is not essential to the explanation of the action of digitalis in increasing the force of contraction of the failing mammalian heart.},

Here, we provide the first evidence of trans-generational medication, in which animals actively use medicine to mitigate disease in their offspring. We studied monarch butterflies and their virulent protozoan parasites, and found that neither caterpillars nor adult butterflies could cure themselves of disease. Instead, adult butterflies preferentially laid their eggs on toxic plants that reduced parasite growth and disease in their offspring caterpillars. It has often been suggested that sick animals may use medication to cure themselves of disease, but evidence for the use of medication in nature has so far been scarce. Our results provide evidence that infected animals may indeed use medicine as a defence against parasites, and that such medication may target an individual’s offspring rather than the individual itself.},
