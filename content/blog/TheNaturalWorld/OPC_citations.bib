	abstract = {The latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts a 1.4-5.8 degree C average increase in the global surface temperature over the period 1990 to 2100. These estimates of future warming are greater than earlier projections, which is partly due to incorporation of a positive feedback. This feedback results from further release of greenhouse gases from terrestrial ecosystems in response to climate warming. The feedback mechanism is usually based on the assumption that observed sensitivity of soil respiration to temperature under current climate conditions would hold in a warmer climate. However, this assumption has not been carefully examined. We have therefore conducted an experiment in a tall grass prairie ecosystem in the US Great Plains to study the response of soil respiration (the sum of root and heterotrophic respiration) to artificial warming of about 2 degree C. Our observations indicate that the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration decreases–or acclimatizes–under warming and that the acclimatization is greater at high temperatures. This acclimatization of soil respiration to warming may therefore weaken the positive feedback between the terrestrial carbon cycle and climate.},

	abstract = {Monarch butterflies, Danaus plexippus, migrate long distances over which they encounter host plants that vary broadly in toxic cardenolides. Remarkably little is understood about the mechanisms of sequestration in Lepidoptera that lay eggs on host plants ranging in such toxins. Using closely-related milkweed host plants that differ more than ten-fold in cardenolide concentrations, we mechanistically address the intake, sequestration, and excretion of cardenolides by monarchs. We show that on high cardenolide plant species, adult butterflies saturate in cardenolides, resulting in lower concentrations than in leaves, while on low cardenolide plants, butterflies concentrate toxins. Butterflies appear to focus their sequestration on particular compounds, as the diversity of cardenolides is highest in plant leaves, lower in frass, and least in adult butterflies. Among the variety of cardenolides produced by the plant, sequestered compounds may be less toxic to the butterflies themselves, as they are more polar on average than those in leaves. In accordance with this, results from an in vitro assay based on inhibition of Na(+)/K(+) ATPase (the physiological target of cardenolides) showed that on two milkweed species, including the high cardenolide A. perennis, extracts from butterflies have lower inhibitory effects than leaves when standardized by cardenolide concentration, indicating selective sequestration of less toxic compounds from these host plants. To understand how ontogeny shapes sequestration, we examined cardenolide concentrations in caterpillar body tissues and hemolymph over the course of development. Caterpillars sequestered higher concentrations of cardenolides as early instars than as late instars, but within the fifth instar, concentration increased with body mass. Although it appears that large amounts of sequestration occurs in early instars, a host switching experiment revealed that caterpillars can compensate for feeding on low cardenolide host plants with substantial sequestration in the fifth instar. We highlight commonalities and striking differences in the mechanisms of sequestration depending on host plant chemistry and developmental stage, which have important implications for monarch defense.},

	abstract = {Although crop wild ancestors are often reservoirs of resistance traits lost during domestication, examining diverse cultivated germplasm may also reveal novel resistance traits due to distinct breeding histories. Using ten cultivars from two independent domestication events of Cucurbita pepo (ssp. pepo and texana), we identified divergences in constitutive and induced resistance measured by growth of generalist caterpillars and leaf traits. C. p. texana cultivars were consistently more resistant to Trichoplusia ni and Spodoptera exigua, and this was not due to expected mechanisms including cucurbitacins, nitrogen, sticky phloem sap, or toxicity. Although more susceptible on average, C. p. pepo cultivars showed stronger induced resistance, suggesting a trade-off between constitutive and induced resistance. To test the hypothesis that leaf volatiles accounted for differences in resistance to caterpillars, we devised a novel method to evaluate resistance on artificial diet while larvae are exposed to leaf volatiles. In both subspecies, cultivar-specific induced volatiles that reduced T. ni growth were present in highly inducible cultivars, but absent in those that showed no induction. These results have important agricultural implications as cultivar-specific resistance to caterpillars mirrored that of specialist beetles from field trials. Overall, the eponymous cucurbitacin defenses of the Cucurbitaceae are not the mechanistic basis of differences in constitutive or induced resistance between C. pepo subspecies or cultivars. Instead, deterrent cultivar-specific volatiles appear to provide general resistance to insect herbivores. Divergence during breeding history within and between subspecies revealed this pattern and novel resistance mechanism, defining new targets for plant breeding.},

	abstract = {Cardenolides are classically studied steroidal defenses in chemical ecology and plant-herbivore coevolution. Although milkweed plants (Asclepias spp.) produce up to 200 structurally different cardenolides, all compounds seemingly share the same well-characterized mode of action, inhibition of the ubiquitous Na(+)/K(+) ATPase in animal cells. Over their evolutionary radiation, milkweeds show a quantitative decline of cardenolide production and diversity. This reduction is contrary to coevolutionary predictions and could represent a cost-saving strategy, i.e. production of fewer but more toxic cardenolides. Here we test this hypothesis by tandem cardenolide quantification using HPLC (UV absorption of the unsaturated lactone) and a pharmacological assay (in vitro inhibition of a sensitive Na(+)/K(+) ATPase) in a comparative study of 16 species of Asclepias. We contrast cardenolide concentrations in leaf tissue to the subset of cardenolides present in exuding latex. Results from the two quantification methods were strongly correlated, but the enzymatic assay revealed that milkweed cardenolide mixtures often cause stronger inhibition than equal amounts of a non-milkweed reference cardenolide, ouabain. Cardenolide concentrations in latex and leaves were positively correlated across species, yet latex caused 27\% stronger enzyme inhibition than equimolar amounts of leaf cardenolides. Using a novel multiple regression approach, we found three highly potent cardenolides (identified as calactin, calotropin, and voruscharin) to be primarily responsible for the increased pharmacological activity of milkweed cardenolide mixtures. However, contrary to an expected trade-off between concentration and toxicity, later-diverging milkweeds had the lowest amounts of these potent cardenolides, perhaps indicating an evolutionary response to milkweed's diverse community of specialist cardenolide-sequestering insect herbivores.},

The highly specialized monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) copes well with cardiac glycosides (inhibitors of animal Na(+)/K(+)-ATPases) from its milkweed host plants, but selective inhibition of its Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase by different compounds has not been previously tested. We applied 17 cardiac glycosides to the D. plexippus-Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase and to the more susceptible Na(+)/K(+)-ATPases of two non-adapted insects (Euploea core and Schistocerca gregaria). Structural features (e.g., sugar residues) predicted in vitro inhibitory activity and comparison of insect Na(+)/K(+)-ATPases revealed that the monarch has evolved a highly resistant enzyme overall. Nonetheless, we found evidence for relative selectivity of individual cardiac glycosides reaching from 4- to 94-fold differences of inhibition between non-adapted Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase and D. plexippus-Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase. This toxin receptor specificity suggests a mechanism how plants could target herbivores selectively and thus provides a strong basis for pairwise coevolutionary interactions between plants and herbivorous insects.},

Recent advances in uncovering signal transduction networks have revealed that defense trade-offs are often the result of regulatory "decisions" by the plant, enabling it to fine-tune its phenotype in response to diverse environmental challenges. We place these results in the context of classic studies in ecology and evolutionary biology, and propose a unifying framework for growth-defense trade-offs as a means to study the plant's allocation of limiting resources. Pervasive physiological costs constrain the upper limit to growth and defense traits, but the diversity of selective pressures on plants often favors negative correlations at intermediate trait levels. Despite the ubiquity of underlying costs of defense, the current challenge is using physiological and molecular approaches to predict the conditions where they manifest as detectable trade-offs.},

	abstract = {Insect resistance to plant toxins is widely assumed to have evolved in response to using defended plants as a dietary resource. We tested this hypothesis in the milkweed butterflies (Danaini) which have progressively evolved higher levels of resistance to cardenolide toxins based on amino acid substitutions of their cellular sodium-potassium pump (Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase). Using chemical, physiological and caterpillar growth assays on diverse milkweeds (Asclepias spp.) and isolated cardenolides, we show that resistant Na(+)/K(+)-ATPases are not necessary to cope with dietary cardenolides. By contrast, sequestration of cardenolides in the body (as a defence against predators) is associated with the three levels of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase resistance. To estimate the potential physiological burden of cardenolide sequestration without Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase adaptations, we applied haemolymph of sequestering species on isolated Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase of sequestering and non-sequestering species. Haemolymph cardenolides dramatically impair non-adapted Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase, but had systematically reduced effects on Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase of sequestering species. Our data indicate that major adaptations to plant toxins may be evolutionarily linked to sequestration, and may not necessarily be a means to eat toxic plants. Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase adaptations thus were a potential mechanism through which predators spurred the coevolutionary arms race between plants and insects.},

	abstract = {The extent of convergent molecular evolution is largely unknown, yet is critical to understanding the genetics of adaptation. Target site insensitivity to cardenolides is a prime candidate for studying molecular convergence because herbivores in six orders of insects have specialized on these plant poisons, which gain their toxicity by blocking an essential transmembrane carrier, the sodium pump (Na,K-ATPase). We investigated gene sequences of the Na,K-ATPase alpha-subunit in 18 insects feeding on cardenolide-containing plants (spanning 15 genera and four orders) to screen for amino acid substitutions that might lower sensitivity to cardenolides. The replacement N122H that was previously shown to confer resistance in the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) and Chrysochus leaf beetles was found in four additional species, Oncopeltus fasciatus and Lygaeus kalmii (Heteroptera, Lygaeidae), Labidomera clivicollis (Coleoptera, Chrysomelidae), and Liriomyza asclepiadis (Diptera, Agromyzidae). Thus, across 300 Myr of insect divergence, specialization on cardenolide-containing plants resulted in molecular convergence for an adaptation likely involved in coevolution. Our screen revealed a number of other substitutions connected to cardenolide binding in mammals. We confirmed that some of the particular substitutions provide resistance to cardenolides by introducing five distinct constructs of the Drosophila melanogaster gene into susceptible eucaryotic cells under an ouabain selection regime. These functional assays demonstrate that combined substitutions of Q(111) and N(122) are synergistic, with greater than twofold higher resistance than either substitution alone and \${\textgreater}\$12-fold resistance over the wild type. Thus, even across deep phylogenetic branches, evolutionary degrees of freedom seem to be limited by physiological constraints, such that the same molecular substitutions confer adaptation.},

Although laticifers are likely to be of polyphyletic origin, their occurrence is considered a morphological indicator of relatedness among species. The classification of laticifers is based on developmental patterns and overall morphology. The cytoplasmic latex exuded in response to damage often includes specialized metabolites, such as cardenolides, alkaloids and natural rubber. Laticifers provide an effective location to store defense metabolites, although not all latex-bearing plants accumulate bioactive natural products. Ecophysiological studies have shown that latex and its associated metabolites are vital for the defense of plants against insects. The anatomy, development and physiology of laticifers are discussed with a focus on evolutionary and ecological perspectives.},

Questions about the function of latex or the underlying mechanisms persist, but a role in defense is likely. The presence of constitutive peptidases in latex sap in addition to inducible and de novo synthesized pathogenesis-related proteins (PR-proteins), raises the question about the role that each sap component plays to protect plants and how synergism occurs among sap proteins in the course of herbivory or infection. Here we discuss a variety of functions for laticifer and latex in plant defense. We propose that latex peptidases build the front line of defense against herbivores or pathogens.},

A novel experimental method was developed to study negative physical and chemical effects of latex and cardiac glycosides on first-instar monarch butterfly larvae in their natural environment in north central Florida. Forceps were used to nibble through the petioles of leaves of the sandhill milkweed Asclepias humistrata, mimicking the behaviour of mature monarch larvae. This notching cut off the supply of latex to the leaves without significantly reducing either their cardiac glycoside concentration or water content. 2. The mean cardiac glycoside concentration in larvae that fed on intact leaves was nearly two and a half times greater than in larvae that fed on notched leaves. This was probably because more latex is present in the gut of the larvae that fed on the intact leaves. Supporting this is the fact that the mean concentration of cardiac glycosides in the latex was 34–47 times that in the leaves. 3. Wet weights, dry weights, and growth rates of first-instar larvae that fed on intact leaves over a 72-h period were less than half those of larvae that fed on notched leaves. 4. Mortality due to miring in the latex was 27\% on the intact leaves compared with 2\% on the notched leaves. 5. Latex, cardiac glycosides, and other as yet undetermined plant factors all have a negative effect on first-instar larval survival. 6. Video-analyses indicated that ingestion of latex caused the larvae to become cataleptic and increased their chances of being mired on the leaf by the setting latex glue. Dysfunction resulting from latex ingestion may lead to the larvae falling off the plant and being killed by invertebrate predators. 7. The difficulty of neonate monarch larvae surviving on A. humistrata – one of the principal milkweed species fed on each spring as monarchs remigrate from Mexico into the southern U.S.A. – is evidence that a co-evolutionary arms race is operating in this plant–herbivore system.},

	abstract = {The Monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) sequesters cardiac glycosides (CG) for its chemical defense against predators. Larvae and adults of this butterfly are insensitive towards dietary cardiac glycosides, whereas other Lepidoptera are sensitive and intoxicated by ouabain. Ouabain inhibits Na(+),K(+)-ATPase by binding to its α-subunit. We have amplified and cloned the DNA-sequence encoding the respective ouabain binding site. Instead of the amino acid asparagine at position 122 in ouabain-sensitive insects, the Monarch has a histidine in the putative ouabain binding site, which consists of 12 amino acids. Starting with the CG-sensitive Na(+),K(+)-ATPase gene fromDrosophila, we converted pos. 122 to a histidine residue as inDanaus plexippus by site-directed mutagenesis. Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK) (which are sensitive to ouabain) were transfected with the mutated Na(+),K(+)-ATPase gene in a pSVDF-expression vector and showed a transient expression of the mutatedDrosophila Na(+),K(+)-ATPase. When treated with ouabain, the transfected cells tolerated ouabain at a concentration of 50 mM, whereas untransformed controls or controls transfected with the unmutatedDrosophila gene, showed a substantial mortality. This result implies that the asparagine to histidine exchange contributes to ouabain insensitivity in the Monarch. In two other CG-sequestering insects, e.g.,Danaus gilippus andSyntomeida epilais, the pattern of amino acid substitution differed, indicating that the Monarch has acquired this mutation independently during evolution.},

	abstract = {Ehrlich and Raven's postulate that rapid diversification follows innovation in plant defense has often been invoked a posteriori for plant lineages of unusual diversity and chemical distinctiveness. The postulate can be more rigorously tested by defining a novel class of defense using chemical and/or anatomical criteria, independent of taxonomic lineage. If multiple plant lineages have evolved the new defense type, then according to the postulate they should be consistently more diverse than their sister groups (of equal age, by definition) when the latter retain the primitive defensive repertoire. Secretory canals are an independently defined, repeatedly evolved feature that functions to protect plants from herbivores and pathogens. The canals might therefore be expected to allow plant radiation in an adaptive zone of reduced herbivory and disease. We have quantified the evidence for this hypothesis by comparing the diversities of lineages that have independently evolved canal systems with their sister groups for as many plant lineages as current taxonomic evidence allows. A sign test showed that canal-bearing lineages have consistently higher diversities than their sister groups (P = .0021). Explanations for this result, other than selective advantage conferred by secretory canals, are examined and provisionally rejected.},

The roles of those latex proteins and enzymes are as yet poorly understood. We found that papain, a cysteine protease in latex of the Papaya tree (Carica papaya, Caricaceae), is a crucial factor in the defense of the papaya tree against lepidopteran larvae such as oligophagous Samia ricini (Saturniidae) and two notorious polyphagous pests, Mamestra brassicae (Noctuidae) and Spodoptera litura (Noctuidae). Leaves of a number of laticiferous plants, including papaya and a wild fig, Ficus virgata (Moraceae), showed strong toxicity and growth inhibition against lepidopteran larvae, though no apparent toxic factors from these species have been reported. When the latex was washed off, the leaves of these lactiferous plants lost toxicity. Latexes of both papaya and the wild fig were rich in cysteine-protease activity. E-64, a cysteine protease-specific inhibitor, completely deprived the leaves of toxicity when painted on the surface of papaya and fig leaves. Cysteine proteases, such as papain, ficin, and bromelain, all showed toxicity. The results suggest that plant latex and the proteins in it, cysteine proteases in particular, provide plants with a general defense mechanism against herbivorous insects.},

Because the silkworm grows well on mulberry leaves, the toxicities and defensive activities of these leaves against herbivorous insects have been overlooked. Here we show that mulberry leaves are highly toxic to caterpillars other than the silkworm B. mori, because of the ingredients of the latex, a milky sap exuded from mulberry leaf veins. The toxicity of mulberry leaves was lost when the latex was eliminated from the leaves, and artificial diets containing latex showed toxicity. Mulberry latex contained very high concentrations of alkaloidal sugar-mimic glycosidase inhibitors reported to have antidiabetic activities, such as 1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-D-arabinitol, 1-deoxynojirimycin, and 1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-D-ribitol. The overall concentrations of these inhibitors in latex reached 1.5-2.5\% (8-18\% dry weight) in several mulberry varieties, which were approximately 100 times the concentrations previously reported from whole mulberry leaves. These sugar-mimic alkaloids were toxic to caterpillars but not to the silkworm B. mori, indicating that the silkworm can circumvent the mulberry tree's defense. Our results suggest that latex ingredients play key roles in defense of this tree and of other plants against insect herbivory, and they imply that plant latexes are treasuries of bioactive substances useful as medicines and pesticides.},

However, the mechanisms underlying laticifer cell differentiation, growth and production of latex remain largely unknown. In a search for mutants showing enhanced accumulation of latex we identified two LOT OF LATEX (LOL) loci in Euphorbia lathyris. lol2 and lol5 mutants show enhanced production of latex contained within laticifer cells. The recessive lol2 mutant carries increased biosynthesis of the plant hormone jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile) and therefore establishes a genetic link between jasmonic acid (JA) signaling and latex production in laticifers. Instead, heightened production of latex in lol5 plants obeys to enhanced proliferation of laticifer cells. Phylogenetic analysis of laticifer-expressed genes in E. lathyris and in two other latex-bearing species, Euphorbia corallioides and Euphorbia palustris, allowed the identification of canonical JA responsive elements present in the gene promoter regions of laticifer marker genes. Moreover, we identified that the hormone JA functions not as a morphogen for laticifer differentiation but as a trigger for the fill out of laticifers with latex and the associated triterpenoids. The identification of LOL loci represents a further step towards the understanding of mechanisms controlling latex production in laticifer cells.},

Energy usage depends strongly on action potential rate–an increase in activity of 1 action potential/cortical neuron/s will raise oxygen consumption by 145 mL/100 g grey matter/h. The energy expended on signaling is a large fraction of the total energy used by the brain; this favors the use of energy efficient neural codes and wiring patterns. Our estimates of energy usage predict the use of distributed codes, with \${\textless}\$or=15\% of neurons simultaneously active, to reduce energy consumption and allow greater computing power from a fixed number of neurons. Functional magnetic resonance imaging signals are likely to be dominated by changes in energy usage associated with synaptic currents and action potential propagation.},

	abstract = {Cardenolides are remarkable steroidal toxins that have become model systems, critical in the development of theories for chemical ecology and coevolution. Because cardenolides inhibit the ubiquitous and essential animal enzyme Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase, most insects that feed on cardenolide-containing plants are highly specialized. With a huge diversity of chemical forms, these secondary metabolites are sporadically distributed across 12 botanical families, but dominate the Apocynaceae where they are found in \${\textgreater}\$ 30 genera. Studies over the past decade have demonstrated patterns in the distribution of cardenolides among plant organs, including all tissue types, and across broad geographic gradients within and across species. Cardenolide production has a genetic basis and is subject to natural selection by herbivores. In addition, there is strong evidence for phenotypic plasticity, with the biotic and abiotic environment predictably impacting cardenolide production. Mounting evidence indicates a high degree of specificity in herbivore-induced cardenolides in Asclepias. While herbivores of cardenolide-containing plants often sequester the toxins, are aposematic, and possess several physiological adaptations (including target site insensitivity), there is strong evidence that these specialists are nonetheless negatively impacted by cardenolides. While reviewing both the mechanisms and evolutionary ecology of cardenolide-mediated interactions, we advance novel hypotheses and suggest directions for future work.},

	abstract = {Cardiac glycosides are a prime example of highly toxic plant secondary compounds, which block an essential transmembrane carrier in animals, the Na,K-ATPase. Nevertheless, over 100 insect species from diverse orders are known to feed on plants containing these compounds and in many cases these toxins are additionally sequestered without ill effect. We investigated whether the insects’ adaptations for handling cardiac glycosides are based on a single physiological mechanism or whether various strategies have evolved across groups. We analyzed gene sequences of the Na,K-ATPase α-subunit from cardiac glycoside-adapted insects and screened for amino-acid substitutions which could alter the affinity of the enzyme toward cardiac glycosides. In representatives from five insect orders, separated by over 300 million years of evolutionary divergence, we uncovered amino-acid substitutions at identical positions. Especially striking is the convergent substitution of a histidine for the conserved asparagine at position 122, which we report here for the first time in a sawfly, Monophadnus latus Costa (Hymenoptera: Tenthredinidae), and which was previously observed in the orders Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, Hemiptera, and Diptera. Prior in vitro expression and enzyme assays indicated that this substitution as well as combined substitutions with other residues result in a strongly increased cardenolide resistance of the Na,K-ATPase. The substitutions to threonine111 and histidine122 observed in M. latus are highly effective and were previously known only in lygaeid bugs. However, not all insects dealing with dietary cardenolides rely on target-site insensitivity as a mechanism of resistance. An impermeable gut or the exclusion of cardenolides from the nervous tissue with the greatest expression of Na,K-ATPase by the perineurium, the insect blood brain barrier, apparently represent alternative strategies. Immuno-histochemical data presented here support the existence of P-glycoprotein-like efflux transporters in insect gut membranes that might prevent the uptake of allelochemicals like cardenolides.},

The Km for K+ stimulation of Na+/K+-ATPase in M. sexta and D. plexippus is 2.2 mM and for Na+ stimulation in D. plexippus, 6.0 mM. In vitro ouabain concentrations of 1.0 × 10−5 M and 5.0 × 10−5 M in the presence of 7.5 mM K+ inhibited Na+/K+-ATPase activity in H. cecropia and M. sexta by 50\% respectively. Na+/K+-ATPase from D. plexippus was approximately 300 times less sensitive. High concentrations (10−3 M in haemolymph) of ouabain had no effect on M. sexta in vivo. This is largely explained by haemolymph K+ (\${\textgreater}\$; 30 mM) antagonizing the binding of ouabain to Na+/K+-ATPase. As demonstrated in vitro, 30 mM K+ totally protects Na+/K+-ATPase from inhibition by 7.5 × 10−3 M ouabain in D. plexippus and protects the enzyme by 65\% in M. sexta. At least part of the physiological burden incurred in utilization of cardiac glycoside ingestion and storage for protection from predation, however, is probably related to the toxic effects of cardiac glycosides on neuronal Na+/K+-ATPase.},

	abstract = {Na,K-ATPases from various species differ greatly in their sensitivity to cardiac glycosides such as ouabain. The sheep and human enzymes are a thousand times more sensitive than the corresponding ones from rat and mouse. To define the region of the alpha 1 subunit responsible for this differential sensitivity, chimeric cDNAs of sheep and rat were constructed and expressed in ouabain-sensitive HeLa cells. The construct containing the amino-terminal half of the rat alpha 1 subunit coding region and carboxyl-terminal half of the sheep conferred the ouabain-resistant phenotype to HeLa cells while the reverse construct did not. This indicates that the determinants involved in ouabain sensitivity are located in the amino-terminal half of the Na,K-ATPase alpha subunit. By use of site-directed mutagenesis, the amino acid sequence of the first extracellular domain (H1-H2) of the sheep alpha 1 subunit, Gln-Ala-Ala-Thr-Glu-Glu-Glu-Pro-Gln-Asn-Asp-Asn, was changed to that of the rat, Arg-Ser-Ala-Thr-Glu-Glu-Glu-Pro-Pro-Asn-Asp-Asp. When expressed in HeLa cells, this mutated sheep alpha 1 construct, like the rat/sheep chimera, was able to confer ouabain resistance to these cells. Furthermore, similar results were observed when HeLa cells were transfected with a sheep alpha 1 cDNA containing only two amino acid substitutions. This double mutation was a Gln-111—-Arg and Asn-122—-Asp change at the amino terminus and carboxyl terminus, respectively, of the H1-H2 extracellular region. The resistant cells, whether transfected with the rat alpha 1 cDNA, the rat/sheep chimera, or the mutant sheep alpha 1 cDNAs, exhibited identical biochemical characteristics including ouabain-inhibitable cell growth, 86Rb+ uptake, and Na,K-ATPase activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

M. and Lingrel, J. B. (1988) Biochemistry 27, 8400-8408). In order to further study structure-function relationships in Na,K-ATPase, six additional mutations have been made at these border positions. Two of these mutants were single amino acid substitutions (Gln-111 to Arg or Asn-122 to Asp). These mutations change one or the other H1-H2 border residue to a charged amino acid. The remaining substitutions were double mutants in which both of the H1-H2 border residues were simultaneously changed to charged amino acids. Changes were made which introduced either positively charged amino acids (Lys at positions 111 and 122), negatively charged amino acids (Glu at positions 111 and 122) or oppositely charged amino acids (Lys at position 111 and Glu at 122; Asp at position 111 and Arg at 122) at the borders of the H1-H2 extracellular domain. HeLa cells transfected with any of these sheep Na,K-ATPase alpha subunit mutants were able to grow in concentrations of ouabain that were toxic to untransfected cells or cells transfected with the wild type sheep alpha subunit. Crude membranes isolated from the transfectants were analyzed for ouabain inhibitable Na,K-ATPase activity. All of the transfectants contained a relatively ouabain-resistant component of enzyme activity, with the ouabain I50 values ranging from 4 x 10(-3) M to 1 x 10(-6) M. The most resistant enzyme was the double mutant that contained Asp at position 111 and Arg at 122, whereas the least resistant were the enzymes containing the single amino acid substitutions. There was no correlation between the type of charged amino acid present at the border position and the degree of ouabain resistance. These data demonstrate the functional importance, in terms of ouabain binding, of the border positions of the H1-H2 extracellular domain of the Na,K-ATPase alpha subunit.},

Cardiac glycosides not only inhibit the pump function of Na,K-ATPase but also activate intracellular signal transduction pathways, which are important in many biological processes. Recently, antiviral effects have been described as a novel feature of Na,K-ATPase inhibition with the use of cardiac glycosides. Cardiac glycosides have been reported to be effective against both DNA viruses such as cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex and RNA viruses such as influenza, chikungunya, coronavirus, and respiratory syncytial virus, among others. Consequently, cardiac glycosides have emerged as potential broad-spectrum antiviral drugs, with the great advantage of targeting cell host proteins, which help to minimize resistance to antiviral treatments, making them a very promising strategy against human viral infections. Here, we review the effect of cardiac glycosides on viral biology and the mechanisms by which these drugs impair the replication of this array of different viruses.},

The highest density of Na-K-ATPase (20-30 fmol X mm-1) was found in the distal convoluted tubule and the medullary thick ascending limb. Binding was intermediate (10 fmol X mm-1) in the proximal convoluted tubule and connecting tubule, and it was lowest (2-7 fmol X mm-1) in the pars recta, the cortical thick ascending limb, and the collecting tubule. In the medullary thick ascending limb, Scatchard analysis of the specific [3H]ouabain binding indicated a dissociation constant of 1.8 microM. The pump activity was proportional to the number of catalytic units, indicating that the maximal turnover rate of Na-K-ATPase (2,000 ATP molecules per minute per ouabain binding site) was similar in the various segments of the nephron. The method developed for quantitating [3H]ouabain binding is technically simple enough to permit simultaneous measurement of the enzyme in large numbers of tubules and sufficiently sensitive to determine the number of Na-K-ATPase units in each region of the nephron.},

	abstract = {The question about whether evolution is unpredictable and stochastic or intermittently constrained along predictable pathways is the subject of a fundamental debate in biology, in which understanding convergent evolution plays a central role. At the molecular level, documented examples of convergence are rare and limited to occurring within specific taxonomic groups. Here we provide evidence of constrained convergent molecular evolution across the metazoan tree of life. We show that resistance to toxic cardiac glycosides produced by plants and bufonid toads is mediated by similar molecular changes to the sodium-potassium-pump (Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase) in insects, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals. In toad-feeding reptiles, resistance is conferred by two point mutations that have evolved convergently on four occasions, whereas evidence of a molecular reversal back to the susceptible state in varanid lizards migrating to toad-free areas suggests that toxin resistance is maladaptive in the absence of selection. Importantly, resistance in all taxa is mediated by replacements of 2 of the 12 amino acids comprising the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase H1-H2 extracellular domain that constitutes a core part of the cardiac glycoside binding site. We provide mechanistic insight into the basis of resistance by showing that these alterations perturb the interaction between the cardiac glycoside bufalin and the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase. Thus, similar selection pressures have resulted in convergent evolution of the same molecular solution across the breadth of the animal kingdom, demonstrating how a scarcity of possible solutions to a selective challenge can lead to highly predictable evolutionary responses.},

In this review, we focus on two compound classes, iridoid glycosides and cardenolides, which can be found in the food plants of a large number of insect species that display various degrees of adaptation to them. These secondary compounds have very different modes of action: Iridoid glycosides are usually activated in the gut of the herbivores by β-glucosidases that may either stem from the food plant or be present in the gut as standard digestive enzymes. Upon cleaving, the unstable aglycone is released that unspecifically acts by crosslinking proteins and inhibiting enzymes. Cardenolides, on the other hand, are highly specific inhibitors of an essential ion carrier, the sodium pump. In insects exposed to both kinds of toxins, carriers either enabling the safe storage of the compounds away from the activating enzymes or excluding the toxins from sensitive tissues, play an important role that deserves further analysis. To avoid toxicity of iridoid glycosides, repression of activating enzymes emerges as a possible alternative strategy. Cardenolides, on the other hand, may lose their toxicity if their target site is modified and this strategy has evolved multiple times independently in cardenolide-adapted insects.},

Cysteine protease inhibitors such as E-64 and iodoacetamide inhibited proteolytic activity on azocasein; however, the serine protease inhibitors PMSF and leupeptin were more effective. Gut extracts promptly digested LP and were not affected by endogenous latex proteases. Gut extracts, however, did not digest LP from Cryptostegia grandiflora and only slightly digested LP from Plumeria rubra, two plant species that are not consumed by Monarch larvae. The protein profiles of latex proteins extracted from healthy and attacked plants were different. A protein identified as glycoside hydrolase was detected in increased concentrations in latex from damaged plants. Larvae fed on artificial diets containing 1\% or 5\% latex proteins were not adversely affected and gained weight faster than control larvae. These results provide new information on the resistance of Monarch larvae fed on C. procera and suggest that the ability of Monarch proteolytic enzymes to promptly digest LP can explain (at least in part) how these insects overcome the defensive proteins found in C. procera latex.},

The aim of this work was to explore the relation between [Ca(2+)](i) and ROS. When myocytes were in a Ca(2+)-free medium, ouabain caused no change in [Ca(2+)](i), but it increased ROS as it did when the cells were in a Ca(2+)-containing medium. Ouabain-induced increase in ROS also occurred under conditions where there was little or no change in [Na(+)](i). Exposure of myocytes in Ca(2+)-free medium to monensin did not increase ROS. Increase in protein tyrosine phosphorylation, an early event induced by ouabain, was also independent of changes in [Ca(2+)](i) and [Na(+)](i). Ouabain-induced generation of ROS in myocytes was antagonized by genistein, a dominant negative Ras, and myxothiazol/diphenyleneiodonium, indicating a mitochondrial origin for the Ras-dependent ROS generation. These findings, along with our previous data, indicate that increases in [Ca(2+)](i) and ROS in cardiac myocytes are induced by two parallel pathways initiated at the plasma membrane: One being the ouabain-altered transient interactions of a fraction of the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase with neighboring proteins (Src, growth factor receptors, adaptor proteins, and Ras) leading to ROS generation, and the other, inhibition of the transport function of another fraction of the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase leading to rise in [Ca(2+)](i). Evidently, the gene regulatory effects of ouabain in cardiac myocytes require the downstream collaborations of ROS and [Ca(2+)](i).},

The aim of this work was to examine the ouabain-induced events upstream of the Ras/MAPK cascade. Treatment of myocytes with genistein antagonized ouabain-induced activation of the MAPK, suggesting that protein tyrosine phosphorylation has a role. Tyrosine phosphorylation of several myocyte proteins was increased rapidly upon cell exposure to ouabain. Lowering of extracellular K(+) had a similar ouabain-like effect. Ouabain also increased protein tyrosine phosphorylation in A7r5, HeLa, and L929 cells. In cardiac myocytes and A7r5 cells, herbimycin A antagonized the ouabain-induced increase in protein tyrosine phosphorylation and MAPK activation. In both cell types, ouabain stimulated Src kinase activity, Src translocation to the Triton-insoluble fraction, Src association with the epidermal growth factor receptor, and the tyrosine phosphorylation of this receptor on site(s) other than its major autophosphorylation site, Tyr(1173). The findings suggest that (a) the ouabain-induced activation of Src and the Src-induced phosphorylation of the growth factor receptor provide the scaffolding for the recruitment of adaptor proteins and Ras and the activation of Ras/MAPK cascade; and (b) the activation of such pathways may be a common feature of the signal-transducing function of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase in most cells.},

	abstract = {Cardiotonic steroids (CTS), long used to treat heart failure, are endogenously produced in mammals. Among them are the hydrophilic cardenolide ouabain and the more hydrophobic cardenolide digoxin, as well as the bufadienolides marinobufagenin and telecinobufagin. The physiological effects of endogenous ouabain on blood pressure and cardiac activity are consistent with the "Na(+)-lag" hypothesis. This hypothesis assumes that, in cardiac and arterial myocytes, a CTS-induced local increase of Na(+) concentration due to inhibition of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase leads to an increase of intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) via a backward-running Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger. The increase in [Ca(2+)](i) then activates muscle contraction. The Na(+)-lag hypothesis may best explain short-term and inotropic actions of CTS. Yet all data on the CTS-induced alteration of gene expression are consistent with another hypothesis, based on the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase "signalosome," that describes the interaction of cardiac glycosides with the Na(+) pump as machinery activating various signaling pathways via intramembrane and cytosolic protein-protein interactions. These pathways, which may be activated simultaneously or selectively, elevate [Ca(2+)](i), activate Src and the ERK1/2 kinase pathways, and activate phosphoinositide 3-kinase and protein kinase B (Akt), NF-kappaB, and reactive oxygen species. A recent development indicates that new pharmaceuticals with antihypertensive and anticancer activities may be found among CTS and their derivatives: the antihypertensive rostafuroxin suppresses Na(+) resorption and the Src-epidermal growth factor receptor-ERK pathway in kidney tubule cells. It may be the parent compound of a new principle of antihypertensive therapy. Bufalin and oleandrin or the cardenolide analog UNBS-1450 block tumor cell proliferation and induce apoptosis at low concentrations in tumors with constitutive activation of NF-kappaB.},

However, much evidence suggests that abnormal sodium metabolism has a critical role—this has led to the hypothesis that an increase in the circulating concentration of an inhibitor of (Na+/ K+) ATPase is responsible for the increased peripheral vascular resistance in essential hypertension. Evidence for relatively high levels of a Na+ pump inhibitor in essential hypertension has come from bioassay and cytochemical assays of plasma and urine from normotensive and hypertensive individuals. There is also evidence for increased plasma levels of a Na+ pump inhibitor in some animal models (for example, renal and deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) models) of hypertension4. Nevertheless, direct biochemical determination of (Na+/K+) ATPase inhibition by this substance has not yet been reported. We demonstrate here, with a kinetic (Na+/K+) ATPase assay, a highly significant correlation between levels of a plasma inhibitor of (Na+/K+)ATPase activity and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) in normotensive and hypertensive individuals. These data provide evidence for the involvement of a circulating Na+ pump inhibitor in the genesis of essential hypertension. Moreover, our assay methods may be useful for the isolation and characterization of this inhibitor.},

Here, we tested if the Na+/K+-ATPase and Src can form a functional signaling complex. In LLC-PK1 cells the Na+/K+-ATPase and Src colocalized in the plasma membrane. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis indicated that both proteins were in close proximity, suggesting a direct interaction. GST pulldown assay showed a direct, ouabain-regulated, and multifocal interaction between the 1 subunit of Na+/K+-ATPase and Src. Although the interaction between the Src kinase domain and the third cytosolic domain (CD3) of 1 is regulated by ouabain, the Src SH3SH2 domain binds to the second cytosolic domain constitutively. Functionally, binding of Src to either the Na+/K+-ATPase or GST-CD3 inhibited Src activity. Addition of ouabain, but not vanadate, to the purified Na+/K+-ATPase/Src complex freed the kinase domain and restored the Src activity. Consistently, exposure of intact cells to ouabain apparently increased the distance between the Na+/K+-ATPase and Src. Concomitantly, it also stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the proteins that are associated with the Na+/K+-ATPase. These new findings illustrate a novel molecular mechanism of signal transduction involving the interaction of a P-type ATPase and a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase.},

Entomologists have characterized several insect species that have evolved the ability to sequester these glycosides in their tissues to reduce their palatability and, thus, reduce predation. Cardiac glycosides are known to interact with the sodium- and potassium-activated adenosine triphosphatase, or sodium pump, through a specific receptor-binding site. Over the last couple of decades, and since entomologic studies, it has become clear that mammals synthesize endogenous cardenolides that closely resemble or are identical to compounds of plant origin and those sequestered by insects. The most important of these are ouabain-like compounds. These compounds are essential for the regulation of normal ionic physiology in mammals. Importantly, at physiologic picomolar or nanomolar concentrations, endogenous ouabain, a cardenolide, stimulates the sodium pump, activates second messengers, and may even function as a growth factor. This is in contrast to the pharmacologic or toxic micromolar or milimolar concentrations achieved after consumption of exogenous cardenolides (by consuming medications, plants, or insects), which inhibit the pump and result in either a desired medical outcome, or the toxic consequence of sodium pump inhibition.},

Using an initial XAD-2 extraction and preparative high-performance liquid chromatography followed by a batch enzyme affinity extraction and two subsequent semipreparative chromatographic steps, 300 l of human plasma was processed, yielding 31 micrograms (53 nmol) of pure EDLF and representing purification on a dry weight basis in excess of 0.6 billionfold. Four divergent pieces of evidence, including chromatographic, mass spectrometric, immunoreactive, and binding characteristics, suggested that the EDLF purified in the present study was either ouabain or an isomer of ouabain.

A vast amount of data shows that, when added to cell cultures, these steroids promote the growth of cardiac, vascular, and epithelial cells. However, the involvement of the endogenous compounds in the regulation of cell viability and proliferation has never been addressed experimentally. In this study, we show that EO is present in mammalian sera and cerebral spinal fluid, as well as in commercial bovine and horse sera. The lowering of serum EO concentration by the addition of specific anti-ouabain antibodies caused a decrease in the viability of several cultured cell lines. Among these, neuronal NT2 cells were mostly affected, whereas no reduction in viability was seen in rat neuroendocrine PC12 and monkey kidney COS-7 cells. The anti-ouabain antibody-induced reduction in NT2 cell viability was significantly attenuated by the addition of ouabain and was not observed in cells growing in serum-free media. Furthermore, the addition to the medium of low concentrations (nM) of the cardenolide ouabain, but not of the bufadienolide bufalin, increased NT2 and PC12 cell viability and proliferation. In addition, at these concentrations both ouabain and bufalin caused the activation of ERK1/2 in the NT2 cells. The specific ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126 inhibited both the ouabain-induced activation of the enzyme and the increase in cell viability. Furthermore, anti-ouabain antibodies attenuated serum-stimulated ERK1/2 activity in NT2 but not in PC12 cells. Cumulatively, our results suggest that EO plays a significant role in the regulation of cell viability. In addition, our findings support the notion that activation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway is obligatory but not sufficient for the induction of cell viability by EO.},

Recent studies demonstrate the presence of a digoxin analog, ouabain, in mammalian tissue, but its biological role has not been elucidated. Here, we show in renal epithelial cells that ouabain, in doses causing only partial Na,K-ATPase inhibition, acts as a biological inducer of regular, low-frequency intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) oscillations that elicit activation of the transcription factor, NF-kappa B. Partial inhibition of Na,K-ATPase using low extracellular K(+) and depolarization of cells did not have these effects. Incubation of cells in Ca(2+)-free media, inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels, inositol triphosphate receptor antagonism, and redistribution of actin to a thick layer adjacent to the plasma membrane abolished [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations, indicating that they were caused by a concerted action of inositol triphosphate receptors and capacitative calcium entry via plasma membrane channels. Blockade of ouabain-induced [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations prevented activation of NF-kappa B. The results demonstrate a new mechanism for steroid signaling via plasma membrane receptors and underline a novel role for the steroid hormone, ouabain, as a physiological inducer of [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations involved in transcriptional regulation in mammalian cells.},

	abstract = {It is well-known that micromolar to millimolar concentrations of cardiac glycosides inhibit Na/K pump activity, however, some early reports suggested nanomolar concentrations of these glycosides stimulate activity. These early reports were based on indirect measurements in multicellular preparations, hence, there was some uncertainty whether ion accumulation/depletion rather than pump stimulation caused the observations. Here, we utilize the whole-cell patch-clamp technique on isolated cardiac myocytes to directly measure Na/K pump current (I(P)) in conditions that minimize the possibility of ion accumulation/depletion causing the observed effects. In guinea pig ventricular myocytes, nanomolar concentrations of dihydro-ouabain (DHO) caused an outward current that appeared to be due to stimulation of I(P) because of the following: (1) it was absent in 0 mM [K(+)](o), as was I(P); (2) it was absent in 0 mM [Na(+)](i), as was I(P); (3) at reduced [Na(+)](i), the outward current was reduced in proportion to the reduction in I(P); (4) it was eliminated by intracellular vanadate, as was I(P). Our previous work suggested guinea pig ventricular myocytes coexpress the alpha(1)- and alpha(2)-isoforms of the Na/K pumps. The stimulation of I(P) appears to be through stimulation of the high glycoside affinity alpha(2)-isoform and not the alpha(1)-isoform because of the following: (1) regulatory signals that specifically increased activity of the alpha(2)-isoform increased the amplitude of the stimulation; (2) regulatory signals that specifically altered the activity of the alpha(1)-isoform did not affect the stimulation; (3) changes in [K(+)](o) that affected activity of the alpha(1)-isoform, but not the alpha(2)-isoform, did not affect the stimulation; (4) myocytes from one group of guinea pigs expressed the alpha(1)-isoform but not the alpha(2)-isoform, and these myocytes did not show the stimulation. At 10 nM DHO, total I(P) increased by 35 +/- 10\% (mean +/- SD, n = 18). If one accepts the hypothesis that this increase is due to stimulation of just the alpha(2)-isoform, then activity of the alpha(2)-isoform increased by 107 +/- 30\%. In the guinea pig myocytes, nanomolar ouabain as well as DHO stimulated the alpha(2)-isoform, but both the stimulatory and inhibitory concentrations of ouabain were approximately 10-fold lower than those for DHO. Stimulation of I(P) by nanomolar DHO was observed in canine atrial and ventricular myocytes, which express the alpha(1)- and alpha(3)-isoforms of the Na/K pumps, suggesting the other high glycoside affinity isoform (the alpha(3)-isoform) also was stimulated by nanomolar concentrations of DHO. Human atrial and ventricular myocytes express all three isoforms, but isoform affinity for glycosides is too similar to separate their activity. Nevertheless, nanomolar DHO caused a stimulation of I(P) that was very similar to that seen in other species. Thus, in all species studied, nanomolar DHO caused stimulation of I(P), and where the contributions of the high glycoside affinity alpha(2)- and alpha(3)-isoforms could be separated from that of the alpha(1)-isoform, it was only the high glycoside affinity isoform that was stimulated. These observations support early reports that nanomolar concentrations of glycosides stimulate Na/K pump activity, and suggest a novel mechanism of isoform-specific regulation of I(P) in heart by nanomolar concentrations of endogenous ouabain-like molecules.},

Plasma endogenous ouabain levels are significantly elevated in approximately 40\% of patients with essential hypertension and in animals with several forms of salt-dependent hypertension. Also, prolonged ouabain administration induces hypertension in rodents. Mice with mutant Na+ pumps or Na/Ca exchangers (NCX) and studies with a ouabain antagonist and an NCX blocker are revealing the missing molecular mechanisms. These data demonstrate that alpha2 Na+ pumps and NCX1 participate in long-term regulation of vascular tone and blood pressure. Pharmacological agents or mutations in the alpha2 Na+ pump that interfere with the action of ouabain on the pump, and reduced NCX1 expression or agents that block NCX all impede the development of salt-dependent or ouabain-induced hypertension. Conversely, nanomolar ouabain, reduced alpha2 Na+ pump expression, and smooth muscle-specific overexpression of NCX1 all induce hypertension. Furthermore, ouabain and reduced alpha2 Na+ pump expression increase myogenic tone in isolated mesenteric small arteries in vitro, thereby tying these effects directly to the elevation of blood pressure. Thus, endogenous ouabain, and vascular alpha2 Na+ pumps and NCX1, are critical links between salt and hypertension. New pharmacological agents that act on these molecular links have potential in the clinical management of hypertension.},

	abstract = {Arterial smooth muscle (ASM) contraction is triggered by agonist-evoked Ca2+ mobilization from sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The amount of Ca2+ released, and thus, the magnitude of the contractions, depends directly on SR Ca2+ content. Na+ pump inhibition by cardiotonic steroids (CTS) indirectly increases the Ca2+ content of the SR and, thus, contractility. This sequence of events does not, however, account for the multiple Na+ pump alpha subunit isoforms with different affinities for Na+ and for CTS, nor does it explain the cardiotonic and vasotonic effects of low doses of CTS that do not elevate cytosolic Na+ or Ca2+. We show that the Na+ pump high ouabain affinity (alpha3) isoform and the plasmalemmal (PM) Na/Ca exchanger are confined to PM domains that overlie junctional SR in ASM, while low ouabain affinity alpha1 and the PM Ca2+ pump are uniformly distributed in the PM. Thus, low doses of CTS, including an endogenous ouabain-like compound, influence cytosolic Na+ and (indirectly) Ca2+ concentrations only in the cytoplasmic clefts between the PM and junctional SR (a functional unit we call the "plasmerosome"). In turn, this modulates the Ca2+ content of the junctional SR and cell responsiveness.},

	abstract = {We have shown that the Na/K-ATPase and Src form a signaling receptor complex. Here we determined how alterations in the amount and properties of the Na/K-ATPase affect basal Src activity and ouabain-induced signal transduction. Several alpha1 subunit knockdown cell lines were generated by transfecting LLC-PK1 cells with a vector expressing alpha1-specific small interference RNA. Although the alpha1 knockdown resulted in significant decreases in Na/K-ATPase activity, it increased the basal Src activity and tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase, a Src effector. Concomitantly it also abolished ouabain-induced activation of Src and ERK1/2. When the knockdown cells were rescued by a rat alpha1, both Na/K-ATPase activity and the basal Src activity were restored. In addition, ouabain was able to stimulate Src and ERK1/2 in the rescued cells at a much higher concentration, consistent with the established differences in ouabain sensitivity between pig and rat alpha1. Finally both fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis and co-immunoprecipitation assay indicated that the pumping-null rat alpha1 (D371E) mutant could also bind Src. Expression of this mutant restored the basal Src activity and focal adhesion kinase tyrosine phosphorylation. Taken together, the new findings suggest that LLC-PK1 cells contain a pool of Src-interacting Na/K-ATPase that not only regulates Src activity but also serves as a receptor for ouabain to activate protein kinases.},

We report here that reactive oxygen species are required to initiate ouabain-stimulated Na/K-ATPase·c-Src signaling. Pretreatment with the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine prevented ouabain-stimulated Na/K-ATPase·c-Src signaling, protein carbonylation, redistribution of Na/K-ATPase and sodium/proton exchanger isoform 3, and inhibition of active transepithelial (22)Na(+) transport. Disruption of the Na/K-ATPase·c-Src signaling complex attenuated ouabain-stimulated protein carbonylation. Ouabain-stimulated protein carbonylation is reversed after removal of ouabain, and this reversibility is largely independent of de novo protein synthesis and degradation by either the lysosome or the proteasome pathways. Furthermore, ouabain stimulated direct carbonylation of two amino acid residues in the actuator domain of the Na/K-ATPase α1 subunit. Taken together, the data indicate that carbonylation modification of the Na/K-ATPase α1 subunit is involved in a feed-forward mechanism of regulation of ouabain-mediated renal proximal tubule Na/K-ATPase signal transduction and subsequent sodium transport},

	abstract = {The Na/K-ATPase was discovered as an energy transducing ion pump. A major difference between the Na/K-ATPase and other P-type ATPases is its ability to bind a group of chemicals called cardiotonic steroids (CTS). The plant-derived CTS such as digoxin are valuable drugs for the management of cardiac diseases, whereas ouabain and marinobufagenin (MBG) have been identified as a new class of endogenous hormones. Recent studies have demonstrated that the endogenous CTS are important regulators of renal Na+ excretion and blood pressure. The Na/K-ATPase is not only an ion pump, but also an important receptor that can transduce the ligand-like effect of CTS on intracellular protein kinases and Ca2+ signaling. Significantly, these CTS-provoked signaling events are capable of reducing the surface expression of apical NHE3 (Na/H exchanger isoform 3) and basolateral Na/K-ATPase in renal proximal tubular cells. These findings suggest that endogenous CTS may play an important role in regulation of tubular Na+ excretion under physiological conditions; conversely, a defect at either the receptor level (Na/K-ATPase) or receptor–effector coupling would reduce the ability of renal proximal tubular cells to excrete Na+, thus culminating/resulting in salt-sensitive hypertension.},

Although CTS were first considered important in the regulation of renal sodium transport and arterial pressure, more recent work implicates these hormones in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and fibrosis, the modulation of immunity and of carbohydrate metabolism, and the control of various central nervous functions and even behavior. This review focuses on the physiological interactions between CTS and other regulatory systems that may be important in the pathophysiology of essential hypertension, preeclampsia, end-stage renal disease, congestive heart failure, and diabetes mellitus. Based on our increasing understanding of the regulation of CTS as well as the molecular mechanisms of these hormone increases, we also discuss potential therapeutic strategies.},

We present a transcriptome and draft nuclear genome assembly of the common milkweed, Asclepias syriaca. This reconstruction of the nuclear genome is augmented by linkage group information, adding to existing chloroplast and mitochondrial genomic resources for this member of the Apocynaceae subfamily Asclepiadoideae. The genome was sequenced to 80.4× depth and the draft assembly contains 54,266 scaffolds ≥1 kbp, with N50 = 3415 bp, representing 37\% (156.6 Mbp) of the estimated 420 Mbp genome. A total of 14,474 protein-coding genes were identified based on transcript evidence, closely related proteins, and ab initio models, and 95\% of genes were annotated. A large proportion of gene space is represented in the assembly, with 96.7\% of Asclepias transcripts, 88.4\% of transcripts from the related genus Calotropis, and 90.6\% of proteins from Coffea mapping to the assembly. Scaffolds covering 75 Mbp of the Asclepias assembly formed eleven linkage groups. Comparisons of these groups with pseudochromosomes in Coffea found that six chromosomes show consistent stability in gene content, while one may have a long history of fragmentation and rearrangement. The progesterone 5β-reductase gene family, a key component of cardenolide production, is likely reduced in Asclepias relative to other Apocynaceae. The genome and transcriptome of common milkweed provide a rich resource for future studies of the ecology and evolution of a charismatic plant family.},

Here, we explored the roles of Src and the EGFR in the ouabain-invoked pathways that lead to the activation of MAPKs. Exposure of A7r5 and LLC-PK1 cells to ouabain caused a dose-dependent inhibition of Na+/K+-ATPase activity, which correlated well with ouabain-induced activation of Src and MAPKs in these cells. Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that ouabain stimulated Src binding to Na+/K+-ATPase in a dose- and time-dependent manner and increased phosphorylation of Src at Tyr418 but had no effect on Tyr529phosphorylation. Ouabain failed to activate MAPKs in A7r5 cells that were pretreated with the Src inhibitor PP2 and in SYF cells in which Src family kinases are knocked out. Preincubation with AG1478, but not AG1295, also blocked the effects of ouabain on p42/44 MAPKs in A7r5 cells. Significantly, both herbimycin A and PP2 abrogated ouabain-induced but not epidermal growth factor-induced Src binding to the EGFR and the subsequent EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation. Ouabain also failed to affect tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR in SYF cells. In addition, unlike epidermal growth factor, ouabain did not increase EGFR autophosphorylation at Tyr1173. These findings clearly indicate that ouabain transactivates the EGFR by activation of Src and stimulation of Src binding to the EGFR. Furthermore, we found that the transactivated EGFR was capable of recruiting and phosphorylating the adaptor protein Shc. This resulted in increased binding of another adaptor protein Grb2 to the Src-EGFR complex and the subsequent activation of Ras and MAPKs. Taken together, these new findings suggest that Src mediates the inter-receptor cross-talk between Na+/K+-ATPase and the EGFR to transduce the signals from ouabain to the Ras/MAPK cascade.},

Their mechanism is based on the blockage of the heart's sodium potassium ATPase, with a positive inotropic effect. Some of the most well-known CGs are digoxin, ouabain, oleandrin, and bufalin. They have similar chemical structures: a lactone ring, steroid ring, and sugar moiety. Digoxin, ouabain, and oleandrin are classified as cardenolides, consisting of a lactone ring with five carbons, while bufalin is classified as bufodienolides, with a six-carbon ring. Small structural differences determine variations in the toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics of such substances. Most case reports of poisoning caused by CGs are associated with cardiovascular toxicity, causing a variety of arrhythmias and lesions in the heart tissue. Experimental studies also describe important similarities among different CGs, especially regarding species sensitivity. Recent studies furthermore focus on their antineoplastic potential, with controversial results. Data from research studies and case reports were reviewed to identify the main characteristics of the CGs, including toxicokinetics, toxicodynamics, clinical signs, electrocardiographic, pathological findings, antineoplastic potential and the main techniques used for diagnostic purposes.},

	abstract = {Despite the available chemotherapy and treatment, leukemia remains a difficult disease to cure due to frequent relapses after treatment. Among the heterogeneous leukemic cells, a rare population referred as the leukemic stem cell (LSC), is thought to be responsible for relapses and drug resistance. Cardiac glycosides (CGs) have been used in treating heart failure despite its toxicity. Recently, increasing evidence has demonstrated its new usage as a potential anti-cancer drug. Ouabain, one of the CGs, specifically targeted CD34+CD38− leukemic stem-like cells, but not the more mature CD34+CD38+ leukemic cells, making this type of compounds a potential treatment for leukemia. In search of other potential anti-leukemia CGs, we found that Peruvoside, a less studied CG, is more effective than Ouabain and Digitoxin at inducing cell death in primitive myeloid leukemia cells without obvious cytotoxicity on normal blood cells. Similar to Ouabain and Digitoxin, Peruvoside also caused cell cycle arrest at G2/M stage. It up-regulates CDKN1A expression and activated the cleavage of Caspase 3, 8 and PARP, resulting in apoptosis. Thus, Peruvoside showed potent anti-leukemia effect, which may serve as a new anti-leukemia agent in the future.},

	abstract = {A large proportion of cancer patients fail to respond to conventional chemotherapy because of the intrinsic resistance of their cancer to pro-apoptotic stimuli and/or the acquisition of a multidrug resistant (MDR) phenotype during chronic chemotherapy. A new angle in chemotherapeutics against these cancer types associated with dismal prognoses would be the targeting of specific ion channels and pumps over expressed by cancer cells as compared to normal cells. Several reports suggest that the alpha subunits of the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase (referred as sodium pump from now on) could be such targets, using cardiotonic steroids (CS) including cardenolides and bufadienolides. A significant proportion of non-small-cell-lung cancers (NSCLCs), glioblastomas (GBMs), melanomas and kidney cancers overexpresses the alpha-1 subunit of the sodium pump as compared to corresponding normal tissues, while colon cancers overexpress the alpha-3 subunit. Thus, a deeper knowledge of the structure-activity relationship (SAR), in terms of CS-mediated anticancer effects, to the sodium pump alpha subunits might enable the identification of potent anticancer agents with limited cardiotoxicity. The current review provides an in depth SAR analysis with respect to cardenolide- versus bufadienolide-mediated anticancer effects. Moreover, pharmacological data from in vitro and in vivo experiments, as well as pre-clinical and clinical trials regarding cardenolides to combat cancers associated with dismal prognoses are presented.},

We report a new cell-based high-throughput technology for screening chemical libraries against several potential cancer target genes in parallel. Multiplex gene expression (MGE) analysis provides direct and quantitative measurement of multiple endogenous mRNAs using a multiplexed detection system coupled to reverse transcription-PCR. A multiplex assay for six genes overexpressed in cancer cells was used to screen 9000 chemicals and known drugs in the human prostate cancer cell line PC-3. Active compounds that modulated gene expression levels were identified, and IC50 values were determined for compounds that bind DNA, cell surface receptors, and components of intracellular signaling pathways. A class of steroids related to the cardiac glycosides was identified that potently inhibited the plasma membrane Na+K+-ATPase resulting in the inhibition of four of the prostate target genes including transcription factors Hoxb-13, hPSE/PDEF, hepatocyte nuclear factor-3α, and the inhibitor of apoptosis, survivin. Representative compounds selectively induced apoptosis in PC-3 cells compared with the nonmetastatic cell line BPH-1. The multiplex assay distinguished potencies among structural variants, enabling structure-activity analysis suitable for chemical optimization studies. A second multiplex assay for five toxicological markers, Hsp70, Gadd153, Gadd45, O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase, and cyclophilin, detected compounds that caused DNA damage and cellular stress and was a more sensitive and specific indicator of potential toxicity than measurement of cell viability. MGE analysis facilitates rapid drug screening and compound optimization, the simultaneous measurement of toxicological end points, and gene function analysis.},

Increased attention is now paid to the anti-proliferative and apoptosis inducing effect on cancer cells in vitro by glycosides from foxglove as well as by some other glycosides. The present study is a long-term follow-up (22.3 years) of 175 patients with breast carcinoma, of which 32 were on digitalis treatment, when they acquired their breast carcinoma. There was a lower death rate (6\%) from breast carcinoma among the patients on digitalis, when compared with patients not on digitalis (34\%). Also proliferation/aneuploidy was less pronounced of the tumors in patients on digitalis. These observations were statistically significant although the statistical analysis was hampered in the life-table analysis by the fact that only 2/32 patients on digitalis died from breast cancer. Serious consideration should be given to the effects of digitalis derivatives on cancer cells in cancer drug design. This field of research is not sufficiently explored and holds promise to contain drugs superior to present-day adjuvant therapy both with respect to effects and side-effects.},

Digitoxin and digoxin expressed selective toxicity against solid tumor cells from patients, while proscillaridin A expressed no selective toxicity against either solid or hematological tumor cells.

However, malignant epithelial cells with metastatic potential resist anoikis and can survive in an anchorage-independent fashion. Molecules that sensitize resistant cells to anoikis will be useful chemical probes to understand this pathway. To identify novel anoikis sensitizers in anoikis-resistant PPC-1 prostate adenocarcinoma cells, a library of 2,000 off-patent drugs and natural products was screened for their ability to preferentially induce cell death in suspension over adherent culture conditions. This screen identified five members of the family of cardiac glycosides as anoikis sensitizers, including ouabain, peruvoside, digoxin, digitoxin, and strophanthidin. We conducted further studies with ouabain to discern the mechanism of cardiac glycoside-induced anoikis sensitization. Ouabain initiated anoikis through the mitochondrial pathway of caspase activation. In addition, ouabain sensitized cells to anoikis by inhibiting its known target, the Na(+)/K(+) ATPase pump, and inducing hypoosmotic stress. Resistance to anoikis permits cancer cells to survive in the circulation and facilitates their metastasis to distant organs, so we tested the effects of Na(+)/K(+) ATPase inhibition on distant tumor formation in mouse models. In these mouse models, ouabain inhibited tumor metastases but did not alter the growth of subcutaneous tumors. Thus, we have identified a novel mechanism to sensitize resistant cells to anoikis and decrease tumor metastasis. These results suggest a potential mechanism for the observed clinical reduction in metastasis and relapse in breast cancer patients who have undergone treatments with cardiac glycosides.},

The increased mRNAs were proportional to the extent of inhibition of Na+/K+-ATPase and the resulting rise in steady state intracellular Ca2+ concentration. The rapid and sustained increase of c-fos mRNA was shown to be due to increased transcriptional rate. Induction of c-fos by ouabain was prevented when either extracellular or intracellular Ca2+ was lowered and was attenuated by pretreatment of myocytes with a phorbol ester under conditions known to down-regulate protein kinase C. Exposure to ouabain for 24-48 h also increased total transcriptional activity and protein content of myocytes. The findings suggest that the same signal responsible for the positive inotropic action of ouabain, i.e. net influx of Ca2+ caused by partial inhibition of Na+/K+-ATPase, also initiates the rapid protein kinase C-dependent inductions of the early-response genes, the subsequent regulations of other cardiac genes by the resulting transcription factors, and stimulation of myocyte growth.

	abstract = {The c-fos proto-oncogene is known to be regulated by a variety of hormones, growth factors, and other conditions that alter cellular metabolism. The regulation of c-fos RNA concentrations is known to occur both by altered RNA half-life and/or changes in the transcription rate of the gene. In most cases thus far investigated, induction of c-fos transcription by growth factors occurs very rapidly and transiently. Results presented in this paper show that ouabain, a specific inhibitor of the Na/K-ATPase increases the transcription of c-fos, as well as c-jun, in a variety of cultured cells. However, in contrast to other agents that induce c-fos and c-jun expression, the increased transcription rate of these genes in the presence of ouabain required several hours and remained elevated for at least 16 h. NIH 3T3 cells that have been transfected with deletions of the human c-fos promoter have enabled us to define at least two elements within the promotor that are regulated by ouabain. These include the serum response element and a region between 123 and 222 base pairs 5' to the start site of transcription. We speculate that regulation of the intracellular ion balance through changes in Na/K pump activity may be a general mechanism by which basal transcriptional activity of c-fos is modulated.},

	abstract = {Advances in treatment strategies together with an earlier diagnosis have considerably increased the average survival of cancer patients over the last four decades. Nevertheless, despite the growing number of new antineoplastic agents introduced each year, there is still no adequate therapy for problematic malignancies such as pancreatic, lung and stomach cancers. Consequently, it is important to ensure that existing drugs used to treat other types of cancers, and potentially other diseases, are not overlooked when searching for new chemotherapy regimens for these problematic cancer types. We describe a screening approach that identifies chemotherapeutics for the treatment of lung and pancreatic cancers, based on drugs already approved for other applications. Initially, the 1280 chemically and pharmacologically diverse compounds from the Prestwick Chemical Library® (PCL) were screened against A549 (lung cancer) and PANC-1 (pancreatic carcinoma) cells using the PrestoBlue fluorescent-based cell viability assay. More than 100 compounds from the PCL were identified as hits in one or both cell lines (80 of them, being drugs used to treat diseases other than cancer). Selected PCL hits were further evaluated in a dose-response manner. Promising candidates for repositioning emanating from this study include antiparasitics, cardiac glycosides, as well as the anticancer drugs vorinostat and topotecan.},

	abstract = {Identification of novel indications for commonly prescribed drugs could accelerate translation of therapies. We investigated whether any clinically-used drugs might have utility for treating prostate cancer by coupling an efficient, high-throughput laboratory-based screen and a large, prospective cohort study. In stage 1, we conducted an in vitro prostate cancer cell cytotoxicity screen of 3,187 compounds. Digoxin emerged as the leading candidate given its potency in inhibiting proliferation in vitro (mean IC₅₀=163 nM) and common use. In stage 2, we evaluated the association between the leading candidate drug from stage 1 and prostate cancer risk in 47,884 men followed 1986-2006. Regular digoxin users (versus nonusers: RR=0.76, 95\% CI 0.61-0.95), especially users for ≥ 10 years (RR=0.54, 95\% CI 0.37-0.79, P-trend\${\textless}\$0.001), had a lower prostate cancer risk. Digoxin was highly potent in inhibiting prostate cancer cell growth in vitro and its use was associated with a 25\% lower prostate cancer risk. SIGNIFICANCE: Our two-stage transdisciplinary approach for drug repositioning provides compelling justification for further mechanistic and possibly clinical testing of the leading nonchemotherapy candidate, digoxin, a cardiac glycoside, as a drug for prostate cancer treatment. Perhaps of equal importance, our study illustrates the power of the transdisciplinary approach in translational cancer research. By coupling laboratory and epidemiologic methods and thinking, we reduced the probability of identifying false-positive candidate drugs for the next steps in testing.},

By means of a fluorescence microscopy platform that allows for the automated detection of the biochemical hallmarks of such a peculiar cell death modality, we identified cardiac glycosides (CGs) as exceptionally efficient inducers of immunogenic cell death, an effect that was associated with the inhibition of the plasma membrane Na(+)- and K(+)-dependent adenosine triphosphatase (Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase). CGs exacerbated the antineoplastic effects of DNA-damaging agents in immunocompetent but not immunodeficient mice. Moreover, cancer cells succumbing to a combination of chemotherapy plus CGs could vaccinate syngeneic mice against a subsequent challenge with living cells of the same type. Finally, retrospective clinical analyses revealed that the administration of the CG digoxin during chemotherapy had a positive impact on overall survival in cohorts of breast, colorectal, head and neck, and hepatocellular carcinoma patients, especially when they were treated with agents other than anthracyclines and oxaliplatin.},

	abstract = {Cardiac glycosides, which inhibit the plasma membrane Na(+) pump, are one of the four categories of drug recommended for routine use to treat heart failure, yet their therapeutic window is limited by toxic effects. Elevated cytoplasmic Na(+) ([Na(+)](i)) compromises mitochondrial energetics and redox balance by blunting mitochondrial Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](m)) accumulation, and this impairment can be prevented by enhancing [Ca(2+)](m). Here, we investigate whether this effect underlies the toxicity and arrhythmogenic effects of cardiac glycosides and if these effects can be prevented by suppressing mitochondrial Ca(2+) efflux, via inhibition of the mitochondrial Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (mNCE). In isolated cardiomyocytes, ouabain elevated [Na(+)](i) in a dose-dependent way, blunted [Ca(2+)](m) accumulation, decreased the NADH/NAD+redox potential, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS). Concomitant treatment with the mNCE inhibitor CGP-37157 ameliorated these effects. CGP-37157 also attenuated ouabain-induced cellular Ca(2+) overload and prevented delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs). In isolated perfused hearts, ouabain's positive effects on contractility and respiration were markedly potentiated by CGP-37157, as were those mediated by β-adrenergic stimulation. Furthermore, CGP-37157 inhibited the arrhythmogenic effects of ouabain in both isolated perfused hearts and in vivo. The findings reveal the mechanism behind cardiac glycoside toxicity and show that improving mitochondrial Ca(2+) retention by mNCE inhibition can mitigate these effects, particularly with respect to the suppression of Ca(2+)-triggered arrhythmias, while enhancing positive inotropic actions. These results suggest a novel strategy for the treatment of heart failure.},

On the basis of cytotoxicity potency, 10 of the extracts were further characterized for anticancer activity in 10 human tumor cell lines. This final testing resulted in seven potential lead plants with superior evidence of antitumor potential: Colchicum autumnale L. (Colchicaceae), Digitalis lanata Ehrh. and Digitalis purpurea L. (Plantaginaceae), Helleborus cyclophyllus Boiss. (Ranunculaceae), Menyanthes trifoliata L. (Menyanthaceae), and Viola arvensis Murr. and Viola patrinii Ging. (Violaceae). Within a database of antitumor compounds, the activity profiles of the extracts from these seven plants were compared, by correlation analysis, with those of more than 100 other compounds, including 39 standard drugs from different classes of cytotoxic mechanisms. The activity profiles of six of these candidates were uncorrelated with those of the standard drugs, possibly indicating new pathways of drug-mediated cell death.},

These treatments evoked an increase in the contractility of the atria. The time to peak increase was about 30 min, and the inotropic effect was sustained for at least 40 min. After 30 min, 42K was added to the bathing solution in order to estimate the activity of the Na+/K+ pump. A linear relationship was observed between the degree of inhibition of the Na+/K+ pump and the increase in systolic tension. The regression line was the same for low-K solutions and dihydroouabain but not for ouabain. For a given degree of inhibition of the pump, ouabain evoked a higher increase in contractility.

This "non-pumping" pool of Na/K-ATPase, like the pumping pump, binds ouabain. Depletion of either cholesterol or caveolin-1 moves some of the "non-pumping" Na/K-ATPase into the pumping pool. Graded knock-down of the alpha1 subunit of the Na/K-ATPase eventually results in loss of this "non-pumping" pool while preserving the pumping pool. Our prior studies indicate that a loss of the non-pumping pool is associated with a loss of receptor function as evidenced by the failure of ouabain administration to induce the activation of Src and/or ERK. Therefore, our new findings suggest that a substantial amount of surface-expressed Na/K-ATPase, at least in some types of cells, may function as non-canonical ouabain-binding receptors.},

	abstract = {Terpenoids (isoprenoids) represent the largest and most diverse class of chemicals among the myriad compounds produced by plants. Plants employ terpenoid metabolites for a variety of basic functions in growth and development but use the majority of terpenoids for more specialized chemical interactions and protection in the abiotic and biotic environment. Traditionally, plant-based terpenoids have been used by humans in the food, pharmaceutical, and chemical industries, and more recently have been exploited in the development of biofuel products. Genomic resources and emerging tools in synthetic biology facilitate the metabolic engineering of high-value terpenoid products in plants and microbes. Moreover, the ecological importance of terpenoids has gained increased attention to develop strategies for sustainable pest control and abiotic stress protection. Together, these efforts require a continuous growth in knowledge of the complex metabolic and molecular regulatory networks in terpenoid biosynthesis. This chapter gives an overview and highlights recent advances in our understanding of the organization, regulation, and diversification of core and specialized terpenoid metabolic pathways, and addresses the most important functions of volatile and nonvolatile terpenoid specialized metabolites in plants.},

Through the aid of genetic engineering its role can by magnified to broad spectrum by improving genetic ability of crop plants, enhancing the aroma quality of fruits and flowers and the production of pharmaceutical terpenoids contents in medicinal plants. Terpenoids are structurally diverse and the most abundant plant secondary metabolites, playing an important role in plant life through direct and indirect plant defenses, by attracting pollinators and through different interactions between the plants and their environment. Terpenoids are also significant because of their enormous applications in the pharmaceutical, food and cosmetics industries. Due to their broad distribution and functional versatility, efforts are being made to decode the biosynthetic pathways and comprehend the regulatory mechanisms of terpenoids. This review summarizes the recent advances in biosynthetic pathways, including the spatiotemporal, transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. Moreover, we discuss the multiple functions of the terpene synthase genes (TPS), their interaction with the surrounding environment and the use of genetic engineering for terpenoid production in model plants. Here, we also provide an overview of the significance of terpenoid metabolic engineering in crop protection, plant reproduction and plant metabolic engineering approaches for pharmaceutical terpenoids production and future scenarios in agriculture, which call for sustainable production platforms by improving different plant traits.},

	abstract = {Cardioactive glycosides, like digoxin, ouabain and related compounds, are drugs that inhibit Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase and have a strong inotropic effect on heart: they cause the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger to extrude Na+ in exchange with Ca(2+) and therefore increase the [Ca(2+)](i) concentration. For this reason, some of these drugs are currently used in the treatment of congestive heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias. Recently it has been discovered that cardiac glycosides exert pleiotropic effects on many aspects of cell metabolism. Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase is not the exclusive target, as they affect the cell response to hypoxia, modulate several signaling pathways involved in cell death and proliferation, regulate the transcription of different genes and modify the pharmacokinetics of other drugs, by altering the expression and activity of drug-metabolizing enzymes. Some of these effects are related to the steroid structure of glycosides, a property which also makes them fine modulators of the synthesis of cholesterol and steroid hormones. Moreover, new endogenously synthesized glycosides have been discovered in the last years: these molecules are involved in the balance of salt and in the control of blood pressure. This review will focus on the recent studies which have demonstrated that exogenous and endogenous glycosides, besides playing a role as inotropic agents, are also important in the pathogenesis and therapy of different human diseases, such as stroke, diabetes, neurological diseases and cancer.},

	abstract = {With an overall 5 year survival rate as low as 15\% for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), even with surgical intervention and the use of newer molecules in adjuvant chemotherapy, there is an urgent need for new biological targets and associated novel anti-cancer agents. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the potential of the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase alpha1 subunit as a novel target in NSCLC and revealed that alpha1 expression is markedly higher in a significant proportion of NSCLC clinical samples compared to normal lung tissue. Furthermore, reduction in alpha1 expression in A549 NSCLC cells by anti-alpha1 siRNA resulted in markedly impaired proliferation and migration of these cancer cells. Finally, of three cardenolides investigated, UNBS1450, which is known to bind to Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase and displays potent anti-tumour activity in vivo in experimental models of human NSCLCs, is the most potent inhibitor of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase isozymes (alpha1beta1, alpha2beta1 and alpha3beta1), most strikingly of alpha1beta1. This was reflected in the compound's more potent anti-proliferative activity in all NSCLC cell lines evaluated (A549, Cal-12T, NCI-H727 and A427); the first three of which over-express alpha1. The marked impairment in A549 NSCLC cell proliferation and migration, and resulting similar morphology following anti-alpha1 siRNA or UNBS1450 treatment, was associated with features of abnormal cytokinesis, mediated in the case of UNBS1450 by disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. Collectively these data strongly suggest that targeting the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase alpha1 using specific cardenolides could represent a novel means to combat certain NSCLCs.},

MDR1 mRNA expression in Caco-2 or LS180 cells was increased by exposure to 1 microM digoxin for 24h, in a concentration-dependent manner, but SXR mRNA decreased concentration-dependently and was undetectable or significantly lower at 1 microM digoxin, indicating antithetical changes in MDR1 and SXR mRNA expression. Moreover, the MDR1 mRNA level was higher in Caco/DX cells than Caco-2 cells, whereas the SXR mRNA level was lower in Caco/DX cells. Consequently, digoxin was demonstrated to up-regulate MDR1 mRNA and simultaneously down-regulate SXR mRNA expression.},

We investigated the role of (E)-β-caryophyllene in floral defense against a microbial pathogen. This sesquiterpene is a common volatile compound emitted from flowers, and is a major volatile released from the stigma of Arabidopsis thaliana flowers. Arabidopsis thaliana lines lacking a functional (E)-β-caryophyllene synthase or constitutively overexpressing this gene were challenged with Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000, which is a bacterial pathogen of brassicaceous plants. Flowers of plant lines lacking (E)-β-caryophyllene emission showed greater bacterial growth on their stigmas than did wild-type flowers, and their seeds were lighter and misshapen. By contrast, plant lines with ectopic (E)-β-caryophyllene emission from vegetative parts were more resistant than wild-type plants to pathogen infection of leaves, and showed reduced cell damage and higher seed production. Based on in vitro experiments, (E)-β-caryophyllene seems to act by direct inhibition of bacterial growth, rather than by triggering defense signaling pathways. (E)-β-Caryophyllene thus appears to serve as a defense against pathogens that invade floral tissues and, like other floral volatiles, may play multiple roles in defense and pollinator attraction.},

	abstract = {Essential oils, which are mixtures of terpenes, frequently show stronger insecticide activity, i.e., lower lethal dose 50 (LC50), than their most abundant terpenes. Synergy between terpenes provides a plausible explanation, but its demonstration has been elusive. In the present work, we look for an alternative explanation, by considering the influence of insect metabolic detoxification. Basically, we propose a model (metabolic model, MM) in which the LC50 of the major terpene in a mixture is expected to include a fraction that is detoxified by the insect, whereas a minor terpene would act unimpeded, showing a lower LC50 than when acting alone. In order to test this idea, we analyzed the effects of inhibiting the cytochrome P450 detoxification system with piperonyl butoxide (PBO), on the lethal concentration of terpenes as fumigants against Musca domestica. We found that, within a group of 10 terpenes [linalool, citronellal, (R)-α-pinene, 1,8-cineole, γ-terpinene, limonene, α-terpinene, (S)-β-pinene, thymol and (R)-pulegone], seven showed the LC50PBO (the lethal concentration for PBO-treated flies) between 1.7 and 12.4 times lower than the corresponding LC50 when P450 was not inhibited. Only in one case, that of (R)-pulegone, was the LC50PBO greater than the LC50, while two terpenes [(S)-β-pinene and thymol] showed no changes in toxicity. The increased activity of most terpenes (particularly linalool and citronellal) in PBO-treated flies supports our hypothesis that normally the LC50 includes a fraction of inactive compound, due to detoxification. Having previously determined that M. domestica preferentially oxidizes the most abundant terpene in a mixture, while terpenes in smaller proportions are poorly or not detoxified by the P450 system, we assessed whether the toxicity of minority terpenes in a mixture is similar to their activity under P450 inhibition. We chose suitable binary combinations in such a way that one terpene (in greater proportion) should be the target of P450 while the other (in smaller proportion) should intoxicate the fly with LC50PBO or similar. Combinations of 1,8-cineole-citronellal, 1,8-cineole-linalool, linalool-citronellal, (R)-pulegone-linalool, (R)-pulegone-1,8-cineole and (R)-pulegone-citronellal were assayed against M. domestica, and the LC50 of each mixture was determined and compared to values predicted by MM (considering the LC50PBO for minor component) or by the classical approach (LC50 for both components). The MM showed the best fit to the data, suggesting additive rather than synergistic effects, except for the combination of (R)-pulegone-citronellal that was clearly synergistic. Thus, the experimental data indicate that the insect preferentially oxidizes the major component in a mixture, while the terpene in lesser proportion acts as a toxicant, with higher toxicity than when it was assayed alone. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the higher toxicity of essential oils compared to their component terpenes and provide important information for the design of effective insecticides based on essential oils or terpenes.},

The activation of jasmonic acid biosynthesis by cell wall elicitors, the peptide systemin, and other compounds will be related to the function of jasmonates in plants.

Although many (ca. 10\%) of plant species exude latex or exudates, and although the defensive roles of plant latex against herbivorous insects have long been suggested by several studies, the detailed roles and functions of various latex ingredients, proteins and chemicals, in anti-herbivore plant defenses have not been well documented despite the wide occurrence of latex in the plant kingdom. Recently, however, substantial progress has been made. Several latex proteins, including cysteine proteases and chitin-related proteins, have been shown to play important defensive roles against insect herbivory. In the mulberry (Morus spp.)-silkworm (Bombyx mori) interaction, an old and well-known model system of plant-insect interaction, plant latex and its ingredients–sugar-mimic alkaloids and defense protein MLX56–are found to play key roles. Complicated molecular interactions between Apocynaceae species and its specialist herbivores, in which cardenolides and defense proteins in latex play key roles, are becoming more and more evident. Emerging observations suggested that plant latex, analogous to animal venom, is a treasury of useful defense proteins and chemicals that has evolved through interspecific interactions. On the other hand, specialist herbivores developed sophisticated adaptations, either molecular, physiological, or behavioral, against latex-borne defenses. The existence of various adaptations in specialist herbivores itself is evidence that latex and its ingredients function as defenses at least against generalists. Here, we review molecular and structural mechanisms, ecological roles, and evolutionary aspects of plant latex as a general defense against insect herbivory and we discuss, from recent studies, the unique characteristics of latex-borne defense systems as transport systems of defense substances are discussed based on recent studies.},

	abstract = {Studies investigating the resistance-susceptibility of crop insects to proteins found in latex fluids have been reported. However, latex-bearing plants also host insects. In this study, the gut proteolytic system of Pseudosphinx tetrio, which feeds on Plumeria rubra leaves, was characterized and further challenged against the latex proteolytic system of its own host plant and those of other latex-bearing plants. The gut proteolytic system of Danaus plexippus (monarch) and the latex proteolytic system of its host plant (Calotropis procera) were also studied. The latex proteins underwent extensive hydrolysis when mixed with the corresponding gut homogenates of the hosted insects. The gut homogenates partially digested the latex proteins of foreign plants. The fifth instar of D. plexippus that were fed diets containing foreign latex developed as well as those individuals who were fed diets containing latex proteins from their host plant. In vitro assays detected serine and cysteine peptidase inhibitors in both the gut homogenates and the latex fluids. Curiously, the peptidase inhibitors of caterpillars did not inhibit the latex peptidases of their host plants. However, the peptidase inhibitors of laticifer origin inhibited the proteolysis of gut homogenates. In vivo analyses of the peritrophic membrane proteins of D. plexippus demonstrate resistance against latex peptidases. Only discrete changes were observed when the peritrophic membrane was directly treated with purified latex peptidases in vitro. This study concludes that peptidase inhibitors are involved in the defensive systems of both caterpillars and their host plants. Although latex peptidase inhibitors inhibit gut peptidases (in vitro), the ability of gut peptidases to digest latex proteins (in vivo) regardless of their origin seems to be important in governing the resistance-susceptibility of caterpillars.},

All traits showed significant induction in at least one of the species. Jasmonate application only partially mimicked the effect of monarch feeding. We found some correspondence between latex and cardenolide content and reduced larval growth. Larvae fed cut leaves of A. angustifolia grew better than larvae fed intact plants. Addition of the cardenolide digitoxin to cut leaves reduced larval growth but ouabain (at the same concentration) had no effect. We, thus, confirm that latex and cardenolides are major defenses in milkweeds, effective against a specialist herbivore. Other traits such as proteases and C/N ratio additionally may be integrated in the defense scheme of those plants. Induction seems to play an important role in plants that have an intermediate level of defense, and we advocate incorporating induction as an additional axis of the plant defense syndrome hypothesis.},

	abstract = {Rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis Muell. Arg) is an important economic crop in Thailand. Leaf fall and black stripe diseases caused by the aggressive oomycete pathogen Phytophthora palmivora, cause deleterious damage on rubber tree growth leading to decrease of latex production. To gain insights into the molecular function of H. brasiliensis subtilisin-like serine proteases, the HbSPA, HbSPB, and HbSPC genes were transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana via agroinfiltration. A functional protease encoded by HbSPA was successfully expressed in the apoplast of N. benthamiana leaves. Transient expression of HbSPA in N. benthamiana leaves enhanced resistance to P. palmivora, suggesting that HbSPA plays an important role in plant defense. P. palmivora Kazal-like extracellular protease inhibitor 10 (PpEPI10), an apoplastic effector, has been implicated in pathogenicity through the suppression of H. brasiliensis protease. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR revealed that the PpEPI10 gene was significantly up-regulated during colonization of rubber tree by P. palmivora. Concurrently, the HbSPA gene was highly expressed during infection. To investigate a possible interaction between HbSPA and PpEPI10, the recombinant PpEPI10 protein (rPpEPI10) was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using affinity chromatography. In-gel zymogram and co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays demonstrated that rPpEPI10 specifically inhibited and interacted with HbSPA. The targeting of HbSPA by PpEPI10 revealed a defense-counterdefense mechanism, which is mediated by plant protease and pathogen protease inhibitor, in H. brasiliensis-P. palmivora interactions.},

This sensory capacity is largely mediated through plasma membrane and cytosol-localized receptors which trigger complex downstream immune signaling cascades. As immune signaling outputs are often associated with a high fitness cost, precise regulation of this signaling is critical. Protease-mediated proteolysis represents an important form of pathway regulation in this context. Proteases have been widely implicated in plant–pathogen interactions, and their biochemical mechanisms and targets continue to be elucidated. During the plant and pathogen arms race, specific proteases are employed from both the plant and the pathogen sides to contribute to either defend or invade. Several pathogen effectors have been identified as proteases or protease inhibitors which act to functionally defend or camouflage the pathogens from plant proteases and immune receptors. In this review, we discuss known protease functions and protease-regulated signaling processes involved in both sides of plant–pathogen interactions.},

However, in the course of evolution, functional diversification led to the acquisition of novel, plant-specific functions, resulting in the present-day complexity of the plant SBT family. SBTs are much more numerous in plants than in any other organism, and include enzymes involved in general proteolysis as well as highly specific processing proteases. Most SBTs are targeted to the cell wall, where they contribute to the control of growth and development by regulating the properties of the cell wall and the activity of extracellular signaling molecules. Plant SBTs affect all stages of the life cycle as they contribute to embryogenesis, seed development and germination, cuticle formation and epidermal patterning, vascular development, programmed cell death, organ abscission, senescence, and plant responses to their biotic and abiotic environments.

Having already described the building of families and clans in the MEROPS system, we here focus on the lowest level in the hierarchy, in which the huge number of individual peptidase proteins are assigned to a lesser number of what we term 'species' of peptidases. Just over 2000 peptidase species are recognised today, but we estimate that 25 000 will one day be known. Each species is built around a peptidase protein that has been adequately characterised. The cluster of peptidase proteins that represent the single species is then assembled primarily by analysis of a sequence 'tree' for the family. Each peptidase species is given a systematic identifier and a summary page of data regarding it is assembled. Because the characterisation of new peptidases lags far behind the sequencing, the majority of peptidase proteins are so far known only as amino acid sequences and cannot yet be assigned to species. We suggest that new forms of analysis of the sequences of the unassigned peptidases may give early indications of how they will cluster into the new species of the future.},

The database has been expanded to include proteolytic enzymes other than peptidases. Special identifiers for peptidases from a variety of model organisms have been established so that orthologues can be detected in other species. A table of predicted active-site residue and metal ligand positions and the residue ranges of the peptidase domains in orthologues has been added to each peptidase summary. New displays of tertiary structures, which can be rotated or have the surfaces displayed, have been added to the structure pages. New indexes for gene names and peptidase substrates have been made available.

Plant pathogenic oomycetes, such as the potato (Solanum tuberosum) and tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) pathogen Phytophthora infestans, secrete a diverse family of serine protease inhibitors of the Kazal family. Among these, the two-domain EPI1 protein was shown to inhibit and interact with the pathogenesis-related protein P69B subtilase of tomato and was implicated in counter-defense. Here, we describe and functionally characterize a second extracellular protease inhibitor, EPI10, from P. infestans. EPI10 contains three Kazal-like domains, one of which was predicted to be an efficient inhibitor of subtilisin A by an additivity-based sequence to reactivity algorithm (Laskowski algorithm). The epi10 gene was up-regulated during infection of tomato, suggesting a potential role during pathogenesis. Recombinant EPI10 specifically inhibited subtilisin A among the major serine proteases, and inhibited and interacted with P69B subtilase of tomato. The finding that P. infestans evolved two distinct and structurally divergent protease inhibitors to target the same plant protease suggests that inhibition of P69B could be an important infection mechanism for this pathogen.},

	abstract = {Summary 1.?In this essay I summarize current trends in the evolutionary ecology of plant defence, while advocating for approaches that integrate community ecology with specific tests of classic evolutionary hypotheses. Several conclusions emerge. 2.?The microevolution of defence is perhaps best studied by reciprocal transplant experiments of differentiated plant populations while simultaneously manipulating the presence of the herbivore(s) hypothesized to be the agent(s) of natural selection. 3. Although there is continued interest in the costs of defence, I argue that some empirical approaches to estimating costs (e.g. genetic engineering) may provide limited insight into evolutionary processes. 4.?Essentially all plants employ several different lines of defence against herbivory. It is thus time to abandon searching for single silver bullet traits and the simple trade-off model (where traits are arbitrarily expected to negatively covary across genotypes or species). We still know very little about which trait combinations are most effective and have repeatedly evolved together. Thus, some of our prominent theories (e.g. a predicted trade-off between direct and indirect defence) need to be revised. 5.?Studies of the macroevolution of plant defence are enjoying renewed interest due to available phylogenies and analytical methods. Although general trends are not currently surmisable, we will soon have strong case studies evaluating both biotic and abiotic drivers of convergent evolution in defence strategies and the role of defence evolution in the adaptive radiation of plant lineages. 6.?The evolution of specificity is proposed as a final frontier in understanding complexity in plant?herbivore interactions. Although it is abundantly clear that plants can deploy highly specific defensive responses that are differentially perceived by herbivore species, how such responses evolve and are physiologically regulated remains an important gap. Relatively straightforward methodologies are now available to close the loop between plant perception of herbivory, hormonal responses, and production of defensive end-products across genotype or species.},

	abstract = {SummaryOur paper addresses field survivorship of first instar monarch butterfly larvae (Danaus plexippus L., Lep.: Danainae) in relation to the dual cardenolide and latex chemical defenses of the sand hill milkweed plant,Asclepias humistrata (Asclepiadaceae) growing naturally in north central Florida. Survival of first instar larvae in the field was 11.5\% in the first experiment (15–20 April 1990), and dropped to 3.4\% in the second experiment (20–30 April). About 30\% of the larvae were found glued to the leaf surface by the milkweed latex. Predator exclusion of non-flying inverte-brates by applying “tanglefoot” to the plant stems suggested that the balance of the mortality was due to volant inverte-brates, or to falling and/or moving off the plants. Regression analyses to isolate some of the other variables affecting survivorship indicated that first instar mortality was correlated with (1) increasing cardiac glycoside concentration of the leaves, (2) increasing age of the plants, and (3) the temporal increase in concentration of cardiac glycosides in the leaves. The study also provided confirmatory data of previous studies that wild monarch females tend to oviposit onA. humistrata plants containing intermediate concentrations of cardiac glycosides. Cardiac glycoside concentration in the leaves was not correlated with that in the latex. The concentration of cardenolide in the latex is extremely high, constituting an average of 1.2 and 9.5\% of the mass of the wet and dry latex, respectively. The data suggest that an increase in water content of the latex is compensated for by an influx of cardenolide with the result that the cardenolide concentration remains constant in the latex systems of plants that are growing naturally. We also observed first instar larvae taking their first bite of milkweed leaves in the field. In addition to confirming other workers findings that monarch larvae possess elaborate “sabotaging” behaviour of the milkweed's latex system, we discovered that several larvae on their first bite involuntarily imbided a small globule of latex and instantly became cataleptic. This catalepsis, lasting up to 10 min, may have been in response to the high concentration of cardenolide present in the latex ofA. humistrata, more than 10 times that in the leaves. The results of the present study suggest that more attention should be directed to plant chemical defenses upon initial attack by first instar insect larvae, rather than attempting correlations of plant chemistry with older larvae that have already passed the early instar gauntlet. The first bite of neonate insects may be the most critical moment for coping with the chemical defenses of many plants and may play a much more important role in the evolution of insect herbivory than has previously been recognized.},

When Manduca sexta larvae attack their host plant, Nicotiana attenuata, the plant's wound response is reconfigured at transcriptional, phytohormonal, and defensive levels due to the introduction of oral secretions (OS) into wounds during feeding. We show that OS dramatically amplify wound-induced MAPK activity and that fatty acid-amino acid conjugates in M. sexta OS are the elicitors. Virus-induced gene silencing of salicylic acid-induced protein kinase (SIPK) and wound-induced protein kinase revealed their importance in mediating wound and OS-elicited hormonal responses and transcriptional regulation of defense-related genes. We found that after applying OS to wounds created in one portion of a leaf, SIPK is activated in both wounded and specific unwounded regions of the leaf but not in phylotactically connected adjacent leaves. We propose that M. sexta attack elicits a mobile signal that travels to nonwounded regions of the attacked leaf where it activates MAPK signaling and, thus, downstream responses; subsequently, a different signal is transported by the vascular system to systemic leaves to initiate defense responses without activating MAPKs in systemic leaves.},

	abstract = {Summary.Late instar larvae of the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus L., Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) deactivate the latex defense of milkweeds by chewing a furrow in the leaf midrib or petiole. The larva then feeds beyond the cut where latex outflow is minimal. If a larva does encounter latex exudate during feeding, it often returns to its initial cut to damage the midrib or petiole more extensively before resuming feeding. We used this response to latex as an assay for testing what cue triggers vein cutting. A sticky solution of polyethylene glycol and a mixture of cardenolides both were ineffective; drops applied to the mouthparts of feeding monarchs failed to elicit renewed vein cutting. Activity resided instead within a methanol extract of the supernatant obtained from centrifuged latex of the milkweed, Asclepias curassavica L. (Asclepiadaceae). Treatment with proteinase K did not eliminate activity documenting that the active compound is unlikely to be proteinaceous. Our results indicate that latex adhesiveness and low polarity cardenolides are relatively unimportant releasers of vein cutting. We propose that milkweeds contain noncardenolide stimulants of vein cutting; these compounds presumably serve a defensive role for milkweeds. Over 50 species of insects are known to employ vein-cutting before feeding on plants with canal-borne exudates; most of these species are dietary specialists like the monarch. Our behavioral assay provides a novel approach for identifying ecologically-significant compounds in the exudates of their diverse host plants.},

	abstract = {Plants are prone to a number of pathogens and abiotic stresses that cause various disorders. However, plants possess a defense mechanism to cope with these stresses. The osmotin protein belongs to the PR-5 family of Pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins, which are produced in response to diseases caused by various biotic and abiotic stresses. Osmotin uses a signal transduction pathway to inhibit the activity of defensive cell wall barriers and increases its own cytotoxic efficiency. However, in response to cytotoxic effects, this pathway stimulates a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade that triggers changes in the cell wall and enables osmotin's entrance into the plasma membrane. This mechanism involves cell wall binding and membrane perturbation, although the complete mechanism of osmotin activity has not been fully elucidated. Osmotin possesses an acidic cleft that is responsible for communication with its receptor in the plasma membrane of fungi. Osmotin is also involved in the initiation of apoptosis and programmed cell death, whereas its overexpression causes the accumulation of proline in transgenic plants. A higher concentration of osmotin can cause the lysis of hyphae tips. This review highlights the role of osmotin protein in the plant defense mechanism and its mode of action against numerous pathogens in wild and transgenic plants.},

	abstract = {Despite the recognition that phytohormonal signaling mediates induced responses to herbivory, we still have little understanding of how such signaling varies among closely related species and may generate herbivore-specific induced responses. We studied closely related milkweeds (Asclepias) to link: 1) plant damage by two specialist chewing herbivores (milkweed leaf beetles Labidomera clivicolis and monarch caterpillars Danaus plexippus); 2) production of the phytohormones jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA), and abscisic acid (ABA); 3) induction of defensive cardenolides and latex; and 4) impacts on Danaus caterpillars. We first show that A. syriaca exhibits induced resistance following monarch herbivory (i.e., reduced monarch growth on previously damaged plants), while the defensively dissimilar A. tuberosa does not. We next worked with a broader group of five Asclepias, including these two species, that are highly divergent in defensive traits yet from the same clade. Three of the five species showed herbivore-induced changes in cardenolides, while induced latex was found in four species. Among the phytohormones, JA and ABA showed specific responses (although they generally increased) to insect species and among the plant species. In contrast, SA responses were consistent among plant and herbivore species, showing a decline following herbivore attack. Jasmonic acid showed a positive quantitative relationship only with latex, and this was strongest in plants damaged by D. plexippus. Although phytohormones showed qualitative tradeoffs (i.e., treatments that enhanced JA reduced SA), the few significant individual plant-level correlations among hormones were positive, and these were strongest between JA and ABA in monarch damaged plants. We conclude that: 1) latex exudation is positively associated with endogenous JA levels, even among low-latex species; 2) correlations among milkweed hormones are generally positive, although herbivore damage induces a divergence (tradeoff) between JA and SA; 3) induction of cardenolides and latex are not necessarily physiologically linked; and 4) even very closely related species show highly divergent induction, with some species showing strong defenses, hormonally-mediated induction, and impacts on herbivores, while other milkweed species apparently use alternative strategies to cope with insect attack.},

This association is attributed to the cross-reactivity between the major latex allergen hevein and hevein-like domains (HLDs) from fruit class I chitinases. We aimed to assess the extent of cross-reactivity between hevein and HLDs using sera from latex-allergic patients with and without plant food allergy. Hevein and HLDs of latex, banana, and avocado chitinases were expressed in Escherichia coli as fusion proteins with the maltose-binding protein and purified by affinity chromatography. IgE binding to these proteins was studied in sera from 59 latex-allergic patients and 20 banana-allergic patients without latex allergy by ELISA and ELISA inhibition. Additionally, 16,408 allergic patients' sera were tested for IgE binding to hevein, latex chitinase, and wheat germ agglutinin using an allergen microarray. Hevein-specific IgE was detected in 34/59 (58\%) latex-allergic patients' sera. HLDs of latex, banana, and avocado chitinases were recognized by 21 (36\%), 20 (34\%), and 9 (15\%) sera, respectively. In contrast, only one of 20 banana-allergic patients without latex allergy was sensitized to chitinase HLDs. In most tested latex-allergic patients' sera, IgE binding to hevein was only partially reduced by preincubation with HLDs. Among hevein-sensitized, latex-allergic patients, the percentage of plant food allergy (15/34 = 44\%) was equal to latex-allergic patients without hevein sensitization (11/25 = 44\%). In the general allergic population, 230 of 16,408 sera (1.4\%) reacted to hevein and/or a hevein-like allergen. Of these, 128 sera showed an isolated sensitization to hevein, whereas only 17 bound to latex chitinase or wheat germ agglutinin without hevein sensitization. In conclusion, the IgE response to HLDs is elicited by hevein as sensitizing allergen in most cases. Despite considerable cross-reactivity between these allergens, no correlation between latex-associated plant food allergy and sensitization to hevein or HLDs was found.},

In turn, the disulfides cross-braced plant AMPs as cystine-rich peptides to confer them with extraordinary high chemical, thermal and proteolytic stability. The cystine-rich or commonly known as cysteine-rich peptides (CRPs) of plant AMPs are classified into families based on their sequence similarity, cysteine motifs that determine their distinctive disulfide bond patterns and tertiary structure fold. Cystine-rich plant AMP families include thionins, defensins, hevein-like peptides, knottin-type peptides (linear and cyclic), lipid transfer proteins, α-hairpinin and snakins family. In addition, there are AMPs which are rich in other amino acids. The ability of plant AMPs to organize into specific families with conserved structural folds that enable sequence variation of non-Cys residues encased in the same scaffold within a particular family to play multiple functions. Furthermore, the ability of plant AMPs to tolerate hypervariable sequences using a conserved scaffold provides diversity to recognize different targets by varying the sequence of the non-cysteine residues. These properties bode well for developing plant AMPs as potential therapeutics and for protection of crops through transgenic methods.

	abstract = {Enormous quantities of latex are found in over 40 plant families on a worldwide basis. Despite the proportions involved, the role of this substance within plants is still a matter of conjecture. Latex is closely associated with isoprene which may be emitted as a gas from both plants (that may or may not contain latex) and animals. The volume of isoprene expelled into the atmosphere each year is approximately equal to that of total methane emissions. The latter (but not the former), a known “greenhouse gas”, is the subject of considerable concern. It appears reasonable, therefore, that efforts be made to examine more thoroughly the formation and function of latex and associated compounds in order to obtain a better understanding of a number of critical biological and environmental phenomena known to be associated with these phytochemicals. Possible roles played by these substances in both plants and their surrounding environment are described.},

	abstract = {The growth inhibitory effects of bufadienolide compounds were investigated in two intractable cancer cells, a human glioblastoma cell line U-87 and a pancreatic cancer cell line SW1990. Among four bufadienolide compounds, a dose-dependent cytotoxicity was observed in these cancer cells after treatment with gamabufotalin and arenobufagin. The IC50 values of the two compounds were 3-5 times higher in normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) than these values for both cancer cell lines. However, similar phenomena were not observed for two other bufadienolide compounds, telocinobufagin and bufalin. These results thus suggest that gamabufotalin and arenobufagin possess selective cytotoxic activity against tumor cells rather than normal cells. Moreover, a clear dose-dependent lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, a well-known hallmark of necrosis, was observed in both cancer cells treated with gamabufotalin, suggesting that gamabufotalin-mediated cell death is predominantly associated with a necrosis-like phenotype. Of most importance, treatment with as little as 8 ng/ml of gamabufotalin, even an almost non-toxic concentration to PBMCs, efficiently downregulated the percentages of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulator T (Treg) cells in mitogen-activated PBMCs. Given that Treg cells play a critical role in tumor immunotolerance by suppressing antitumor immunity, these results suggest that gamabufotalin may serve as a promising candidate, as an adjuvant therapeutic agent by manipulating Treg cells to enhance the efficacy of conventional anticancer drugs and lessen their side-effects. These findings provide insights into the clinical application of gamabufotalin for cancer patients with glioblastoma/pancreatic cancer based on its cytocidal effect against tumor cells as well as its depletion of Treg cells.},

The aim of this review is to show the diversity of the processes that are regulated by proteases, and to summarize the current knowledge of the underlying molecular mechanisms. The emerging picture is that plant proteases are key regulators of a striking variety of biological processes, including meiosis, gametophyte survival, embryogenesis, seed coat formation, cuticle deposition, epidermal cell fate, stomata development, chloroplast biogenesis, and local and systemic defense responses. The functional diversity correlates with the molecular data: Proteases are specifically expressed in time and space and accumulate in different subcellular compartments. Their substrates and activation mechanisms are elusive, however, and represent a challenging topic for further research.},

Plant immunity is a highly complex phenomenon with its own unique features that have emerged as a result of the arms race between plants and pathogens. However, the regulation of these processes is the same for all living organisms, including plants, and is controlled by proteases. Different families of plant proteases are involved in every type of immunity: some of the proteases that are covered in this review participate in MTI, affecting stomatal closure and callose deposition. A large number of proteases act in the apoplast, contributing to ETI by managing extracellular defense. A vast majority of the endogenous proteases discussed in this review are associated with the programmed cell death (PCD) of the infected cells and exhibit caspase-like activities. The synthesis of signal molecules, such as salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, and ethylene, and their signaling pathways, are regulated by endogenous proteases that affect the induction of pathogenesis-related genes and SAR or ISR establishment. A number of proteases are associated with herbivore defense. In this review, we summarize the data concerning identified plant endogenous proteases, their effect on plant-pathogen interactions, their subcellular localization, and their functional properties, if available, and we attribute a role in the different types and stages of innate immunity for each of the proteases covered.},

	abstract = {Plants are invaded by an array of pathogens of which only a few succeed in causing disease. The attack by others is countered by a sophisticated immune system possessed by the plants. The plant immune system is broadly divided into two, viz. microbial-associated molecular-patterns-triggered immunity (MTI) and effector-triggered immunity (ETI). MTI confers basal resistance, while ETI confers durable resistance, often resulting in hypersensitive response. Plants also possess systemic acquired resistance (SAR), which provides long-term defense against a broad-spectrum of pathogens. Salicylic-acid-mediated systemic acquired immunity provokes the defense response throughout the plant system during pathogen infection at a particular site. Trans-generational immune priming allows the plant to heritably shield their progeny towards pathogens previously encountered. Plants circumvent the viral infection through RNA interference phenomena by utilizing small RNAs. This review summarizes the molecular mechanisms of plant immune system, and the latest breakthroughs reported in plant defense. We discuss the plant–pathogen interactions and integrated defense responses in the context of presenting an integral understanding in plant molecular immunity.},

Recent research provides an increasing body of evidence for papain-like cysteine proteases (PLCPs) being central hubs in plant immunity. PLCPs are required for full resistance of plants to various pathogens. At the same time, PLCPs are targeted by secreted pathogen effectors to suppress immune responses. Consequently, they are subject to a co-evolutionary host-pathogen arms race. When activated, PLCPs induce a broad spectrum of defense responses including plant cell death. While the important role of PLCPs in plant immunity has become more evident, it remains largely elusive how these enzymes are activated and which signaling pathways are triggered to orchestrate different downstream responses.},

	abstract = {Proteolytic enzymes are intricately involved in many aspects of plant physiology and development. On the one hand, they are necessary for protein turnover. Degradation of damaged, misfolded and potentially harmful proteins provides free amino acids required for the synthesis of new proteins. Furthermore, the selective breakdown of regulatory proteins by the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway controls key aspects of plant growth, development, and defense. Proteases are, on the other hand, also responsible for the post-translational modification of proteins by limited proteolysis at highly specific sites. Limited proteolysis results in the maturation of enzymes, is necessary for protein assembly and subcellular targeting, and controls the activity of enzymes, regulatory proteins and peptides. Proteases are thus involved in all aspects of the plant life cycle ranging from the mobilization of storage proteins during seed germination to the initiation of cell death and senescence programs.

The hierarchical classification is: protein-species, family, clan, with an identifier at each level. The MEROPS website moved to the EMBL-EBI in 2017, requiring refactoring of the code-base and services provided. The interface to sequence searching has changed and the MEROPS protein sequence libraries can be searched at the EMBL-EBI with HMMER, FastA and BLASTP. Cross-references have been established between MEROPS and the PANTHER database at both the family and protein-species level, which will help to improve curation and coverage between the resources. Because of the increasing size of the MEROPS sequence collection, in future only sequences of characterized proteins, and from completely sequenced genomes of organisms of evolutionary, medical or commercial significance will be added. As an example, peptidase homologues in four proteomes from the Asgard superphylum of Archaea have been identified and compared to other archaean, bacterial and eukaryote proteomes. This has given insights into the origins and evolution of peptidase families, including an expansion in the number of proteasome components in Asgard archaeotes and as organisms increase in complexity.

Like papain, asclepain dots milk and digests most proteins, particularly if they are dissolved in concentrated urea solution. Unlike papain, asclepain did not clot blood. 4. The activation and inhibition phenomena of asclepain resemble those of papain, and seem best explained on the assumption that free sulfhydryl in the enzyme is necessary for proteolytic activity. The sulfhydryl of asclepain appears more labile than that of papain. 5. The measurement of pH-activity curves of asclepain on casein, ovalbumin, hemoglobin, edestin, and ovovitellin showed no definite digestion maxima for most of the undenatured proteins, while in urea solution there were well defined maxima near pH 7.0. Native hemoglobin and ovovitellin were especially undigestible, while native casein was rapidly attacked. 6.

This is considerably higher than the usually quoted figure of 12,500 species. There are more tropical than temperate latex-bearing families, both in absolute numbers and proportionally. Proportions of latex-bearing families are similar both in tropical and in more widespread or cosmopolitan families. Significantly more latex-bearing species belong to tropical than either to temperate or to widespread taxa, both in absolute and in relative terms. These differences may be related to the higher diversity of natural enemy species and to higher rates of herbivory in the tropics.},

	abstract = {In conclusion it should be remembered that the purpose which latex serves in the metabolism of the plant has not been conclusively established. We must also remind ourselves once more that the term ‘latex’ is used in a very loose sense, and the line of demarcation between latex itself and certain other secreted metabolites is by no means clearly defined. It is commonly held that latex is no more than a waste product of metabolism, but, if this is so, it is all the more surprising that laticifers in some at least of the Papaveraceae contain such specialized chemical substances as alkaloids at a very early stage of their development, as Professor Fairbairn’s valuable work (11) has so clearly shown. The mere fact that the latices of different kinds of plants vary in their microscopical appearance and chemical composition suggests that they may not always have the same metabolic significance. Furthermore, the fact that latex is restricted to a small number of plant families, between many of which there is no evidence of close taxonomic relationship, suggests that the capacity to produce latex has been evolved more than once. To the systematic anatomist it seems that there are many morphological entities in the structure of plants, of which laticifers are hut one example, whose existence provides evidence of important underlying differences in metabolism. We are too apt to assume that the metabolism of all photosynthetic plants is uniform. No doubt a basic uniformity exists, but the restricted occurrence of plants with unusual products of metabolism such as latex shows that there is great scope for the study of comparative physiology and chemotaxonomy in the future.},

In this study, crude and dialysed extracts from dandelion root (Taraxacum officinale) were evaluated for their antimicrobial properties against Gram positive and Gram negative bacterial strains. The methanol hydrophobic crude extract (DRE3) demonstrated the strongest inhibition of microbial growth against Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Bacillus cereus strains. Normal phase (NP) fractionation of DRE3 resulted in two fractions (NPF4 and NPF5) with enhanced antimicrobial activity. Further NP fractionation of NPF4 resulted in two fractions (NPF403 and NPF406) with increased antimicrobial activity. Further isolation and characterisation of compounds in NPF406 using liquid chromatography solid phase extraction nuclear magnetic resonance LC-SPE-NMR resulted in the identification of 9-hydroxyoctadecatrienoic acid and 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid, while the phenolic compounds vanillin, coniferaldehyde and p-methoxyphenylglyoxylic acid were also identified respectively. The molecular mass of these compounds was confirmed by LC mass spectroscopy (MS)/MS. In summary, the antimicrobial efficacy of dandelion root extracts demonstrated in this study support the use of dandelion root as a source of natural antimicrobial compounds.},

Cysteine proteases from these plants latex exhibited both thrombin and plasmin like activities. Latex enzyme fraction in a concentration dependent manner induced the formation of clot in citrated blood plasma. Direct incubation of fibrinogen with latex enzyme fraction resulted in the formation of fibrin clot similar to thrombin enzyme. However prolonged incubation resulted in degradation of the formed fibrin clot suggesting plasmin like activity. Latex enzyme fraction preferentially hydrolyzed Aalpha and Bbeta chains of fibrinogen to form fibrin clot. Latex enzyme fraction also hydrolyzed the subunits of fully cross linked fibrin efficiently, the order of hydrolysis was alpha-polymer \${\textgreater}\$ alpha-chains \${\textgreater}\$ beta-chain and gamma-gamma dimer.

Dysregulation of Fli-1 induces hematopoietic and solid tumors, rendering it an important target for therapeutic intervention. Through high content screens of a library of chemicals isolated from medicinal plants in China for inhibitors of a Fli-1 transcriptional reporter cells, we hereby report the identification of diterpenoid-like compounds that strongly inhibit Fli-1 transcriptional activity. These agents suppressed the growth of erythroleukemic cells by inducing apoptosis and differentiation. They also inhibited survival and proliferation of B-cell leukemic cell lines as well as primary B-cell lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) isolated from 7 patients. Moreover, these inhibitors blocked leukemogenesis in a mouse model of erythroleukemia, in which Fli-1 is the driver of tumor initiation. Computational docking analysis revealed that the diterpenoid-like compounds bind with high affinity to nucleotide residues in a pocket near the major groove within the DNA-binding sites of Fli-1. Functional inhibition of Fli-1 by these compounds triggered its further downregulation through miR-145, whose promoter is normally repressed by Fli-1. These results uncover the importance of Fli-1 in leukemogenesis, a Fli-1-miR145 autoregulatory loop and new anti-Fli-1 diterpenoid agents for the treatment of diverse hematological malignancies overexpressing this transcription factor.},

The modular nature of these domains, and the flexibility of their binding properties, have likely facilitated the evolution of cellular pathways. Conversely, aberrant interactions can induce abnormal cellular behavior and disease.

Enzymatic wound debridement is one example of a method currently used that removes necrotic tissue with proteases and offers selectivity without affecting healthy adjacent tissue. Proteolytic enzymes for wound debndement are commercially available as ointments. The authors previously proposed and demon- strated feasibility on small lab animals-an alternative mode of deliv- ery of proteolytic enzymes for wound debridement with continuous streaming of protease solutions. The present study describes the impact of streaming of papain solut ions, fort ified by the incorporation of hypertonic agents, onto an experimental larger chronic wound model in pigs. Debridement of approximately half of the necrotic tis- sue mass was achieved within 6 to 11 h of streaming of papain solu- tions onto these experimental wounds. No adverse effects or notice- able morphological changes to the wound surface or its immediate surroundings were noted, indicating enzyme selectivity and preference for attacking necrotic tissue. The mechanism of enzymatic attack on the necrotic tissue is also discussed. In the control group, streaming of the basic solution formula (devoid of papain) was performed-no debridement of necrotic tissue was noticed in this case. The results indicate that the streaming delivery mode for enzymatic debridement is a highly effective tool designed to be completed in a few sessions. thus paving the way for extension of its application in clinical trials on humans.},

The molecular mass (SDS-PAGE), optimum pH and temperature of the enzyme were 51kDa, pH 8.0 and 60 degrees C, respectively. Milin retains full proteolytic activity over a wide range of pH (5.5-12) and temperature (up to 65 degrees C) with casein and azoalbumin as substrates. The activity of milin is inhibited by serine proteases inhibitors like PMSF, APMSF and DFP, but not by any other protease inhibitors such as E-64 and PCMB. Like the other serine proteases from the genus Euphorbia, the activity of milin was not inhibited by the proteinaceous inhibitor soyabean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI) even at very high concentrations that is naturally present in plants. The specific extinction coefficient (epsilon(280 nm)(1\%)), molar extinction coefficient (a(m)) and isoelectric point of the enzyme were found to be 29, 152,500 M(-1) cm(-1) and pH 7.2, respectively. The enzyme is a glycoprotein with detectable carbohydrate moiety (7-8\%) in its constitution, which is essential for the activity. The numbers of tryptophan, tyrosine and cysteine residues in the sequence of milin were estimated chemically and are 23, 14 and 14, respectively. Of the 14-cysteine residues, 12 constituted 6-disulfide linkages while two are free cysteines. The N-terminal sequence (first 12 amino acid residues) was determined and does not match with any sequence of known plant serine proteases. Perturbation studies by temperature, pH and chaotropes of the enzyme also reveal its high stability as seen by CD, fluorescence and proteolytic activity.

	abstract = {A novel protease is purified to homogeneity from the latex of a medicinally important plant Cryptolepis buchanani of family Apocynaceae (formerly Asclepiadaceae). The enzyme named cryptolepain has a molecular mass of 50.5 kDa. The isoelectric point and extinction coefficient (epsilon280nm1\%) are 6.0 and 26.4, respectively. Cryptolepain contains 15 tryptophans, 41 tyrosines, and eight cysteine residues forming four disulfide bridges. The detectable carbohydrate moiety in the enzyme was found to be 6-7\%. Cryptolepain hydrolyzes denatured natural substrates like casein, azocasein, and azoalbumin with high specific activity. The protease is exclusively inhibited by serine protease inhibitors phenylmethansulfonyl fluoride and diisopropyl fluorophosphate. Hydrolysis of azoalbumin by the cryptolepain is optimal in the pH range of 8-10 and temperatures of 65-75 degrees C. The enzyme shows high stability against pH (2.5-11.5), temperature (up to 80 degrees C), and chemical denaturants. The Km value of the enzyme was found to be 10 microM with azocasein as the substrate. The N-terminal sequence of cryptolepain is unique and shows only little homology to other known serine proteases, which makes this enzyme an ideal candidate for our ongoing biochemical and structure-function investigations of proteases. Easy availability of the latex and simple purification procedures make the enzyme a good system for exploring the biophysical chemistry of serine proteases as well as applications in the food industry.},

In Thailand, the stem of this plant is traditionally used for the treatment of inflammation, including arthritis, and muscle and joint pain. In the current study, the potential anti-inflammatory activity of a 50\% ethanol extract of this plant was evaluated in a number of experimental models. For anti-acute inflammatory activity, results showed that the extract caused reduction of carrageenan-induced rat paw edema in addition to significant reduction of eicosanoid production from calcium ionophore A23187-stimulated rat peritoneal leukocytes. In a test for anti-chronic inflammatory potential utilizing the cotton thread-induced granuloma, the extract caused significant lowering of granulation tissue formation. The reduction of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) release from LPS-stimulated human monocytic cell line (THP-1) was also demonstrated in cells that were pre-incubated with the extract. An additional important feature of Cryptolepis buchanani is its low toxicity, especially by oral treatment, which significantly encourages clinical trials of this extract in the human. In conclusion, the results give scientific support to the traditional use of this plant for combating inflammation. Further investigations are required to identify the active constituents responsible for the anti-inflammatory activity of Cryptolepis buchanani. Subacute and chronic toxicological studies in animals are also needed before clinical trials.},

Stability at different temperatures, optimum pH and ionic strength were evaluated by measuring the residual caseinolytic activity at different times after the incubation. CE showed the highest caseinolytic activity at pH 8.5 in the presence of 12 mM cysteine. CE was purified by cation exchange chromatography (FPLC). Two active fractions, homogeneous by SDS-PAGE, were isolated. The major purified protease (asclepain cI) showed a molecular mass of 23.2 kDa by mass spectrometry and a pI higher than 9.3. The N-terminal sequence showed a high similarity with those of other plant cysteine proteinases.

In order to give new insights into the potential variety of coagulation mechanisms, the untreated natural latices of five latex-bearing plants from the families Euphorbiaceae, Moraceae and Campanulaceae were visualised using Cryo-SEM and their particle size compared using the laser diffraction method. Additionally, the laticifers of these plants species were examined in planta via Cryo-SEM. Similar latex particle sizes and shape were found in Ficus benjamina and Hevea brasiliensis. Hence, and due to other similarities, we hypothesize comparable, mainly chemical, coagulation mechanisms in these two species, whereas a physical coagulation mechanism is proposed for the latex of Euphorbia spp. The latter mechanism is based on the huge amount of densely packed particles that after evaporation of water build a large surface area, which accelerates the coagulation procedure.},

Here, we analyze the literature for such critical short amino acid motifs to determine the minimal peptide length involved in biologically important interactions. We report the pentapeptide unit as a common minimal amino acid sequence critically involved in peptide-protein interaction and immune recognition. The present survey may have implications in defining the dimensional module for peptide-based therapeutical approaches such as the development of novel antibiotics, enzyme inhibitors/activators, mimetic agonists/antagonists of neuropeptides, thrombolitic agents, specific anti-viral agents, etc. In such a therapeutical context, it is of considerable interest that low molecular weight peptides can easily cross biological barriers, are less susceptible to protease attacks, and can be administered at high concentrations. In addition, small peptides are a rational target for strategies aimed at antigen-specific immunotherapeutical intervention. As an example, specific short peptide fragments might be used to elicit antibodies capable of reacting with the full-length proteins containing the peptide fragment's amino acid sequence, so abolishing the risk of cross-reactivity.},

The active factors involved are biochemically characterized only in part. Due to its efficacy after oral administration, its safety and lack of undesired side effects, bromelain has earned growing acceptance and compliance among patients as a phytotherapeutical drug. A wide range of therapeutic benefits has been claimed for bromelain, such as reversible inhibition of platelet aggregation, angina pectoris, bronchitis, sinusitis, surgical traumas, thrombophlebitis, pyelonephritis and enhanced absorption of drugs, particularly of antibiotics. Biochemical experiments indicate that these pharmacological properties depend on the proteolytic activity only partly, suggesting the presence of nonprotein factors in bromelain. Recent results from preclinical and pharmacological studies recommend bromelain as an orally given drug for complementary tumor therapy: bromelain acts as an immunomodulator by raising the impaired immunocytotoxicity of monocytes against tumor cells from patients and by inducing the production of distinct cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-a, interleukin (Il)-1beta, Il-6, and Il-8. In a recent clinical study with mammary tumor patients, these findings could be partially confirmed. Especially promising are reports on animal experiments claiming an antimetastatic efficacy and inhibition of metastasis-associated platelet aggregation as well as inhibition of growth and invasiveness of tumor cells. Apparently, the antiinvasive activity does not depend on the proteolytic activity. This is also true for bromelain effects on the modulation of immune functions, its potential to eliminate burn debris and to accelerate wound healing. Whether bromelain will gain wide acceptance as a drug that inhibits platelet aggregation, is antimetastatic and facilitates skin debridement, among other indications, will be determined by further clinical trials. The claim that bromelain cannot be effective after oral administration is definitely refuted at this time.},

The change in 2D and 3D conformation of bromelain after encapsulation was studied by Circular Dichroism and Fluorometry, respectively. It was found that after encapsulation, a 19.4\% loss in secondary structure was observed, but tertiary structure was not altered significantly and this loss improved the anticancer activity.

This review summarizes data from seven studies, four of which were randomized clinical trials that included a SOC or control vehicle. DGD eschar debridement efficacy was \${\textgreater}\$90\% in all studies, comparable to the SOC and significantly greater than the control vehicle.

The incidence of surgical debridement in patients treated with DGD was lower than the SOC (40/163 [24.5\%] vs. 119/170 [70.0\%], P0.001). Less autografting was used in all studies. Long-term scar quality and function were similar in DGD- and SOCtreated. DGD is a safe and effective method of burn debridement that offers an alternative to surgical and non-surgical SOC.},

Bromelain is a complex mixture of protease extracted from the fruit or stem of the pineapple plant. Although the complete molecular mechanism of action of bromelain has not been completely identified, bromelain gained universal acceptability as a phytotherapeutic agent due to its history of safe use and lack of side effects. Bromelain is widely administered for its well-recognized properties, such as its anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic and fibrinolytic affects, anticancer activity and immunomodulatory effects, in addition to being a wound healing and circulatory improvement agent. The current review describes the promising clinical applications and therapeutic properties of bromelain.},

These qualities are attributed to bromelain, a 95\%-mixture of proteases. Medicinal qualities of bromelain include anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic, fibrinolytic and anti-cancer functions. Existing evidence derived from clinical observations as well as from mouse- and cell-based models suggests that bromelain acts systemically, affecting multiple cellular and molecular targets. In recent years, studies have shown that bromelain has the capacity to modulate key pathways that support malignancy. It is now possible to suggest that the anti-cancer activity of bromelain consists in the direct impact on cancer cells and their micro-environment, as well as in the modulation of immune, inflammatory and haemostatic systems. This review will summarize existing data relevant to bromelain's anti-cancer activity and will suggest mechanisms which account for bromelain's effect, in the light of research involving non-cancer models. The review will also identify specific new research questions that will need to be addressed in order for a full assessment of bromelain-based anti-cancer therapy.},

Fiber characterization and potential market iden tification are critical to its development. The most promising commercial use for milkweed floss is as a loose fill for jackets and comforters. The purpose of this research was to evaluate milkweed floss as an insulative fill material and to compare its per formance to other insulators. Seven identical jackets were constructed using different fill materials matched on a per unit weight basis. The insulation (clo) values for the jackets were measured using a standing, heated manikin in an environmental chamber. Thickness (loft), compression, resiliency, and hand were also measured. Several per formance characteristics were evaluated before and after cleaning. The results show that milkweed floss blended with down has insulative properties similar to down. Down is superior to milkweed floss in loftiness and compressibility, which influence product performance, but the properties of milkweed floss can be enhanced by blending with down.},

Yet, we are only beginning to unravel the multitude of adaptations required for insect specialization on milkweed plants. We review the empirical evidence for specialist insect adaptations toward milkweed toxins, coevolution between insects and milkweed plants, and canonical paradigms for sequestration and highlight the areas for further research.

	abstract = {Certain butterflies utilize plant-acquired alkaloids for their own chemical defense and/or for producing male sex pheromone; a trait known as pharmacophagy. Males of the danaine butterfly, Parantica sita, have been reported to ingest pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) as adults to produce two PA-derived sex pheromone components, viz. danaidone (major) and 7R-hydroxydanaidal. We found, however, that not all PAs that can be precursors for the pheromone serve for mating success of males. Here we show that although the sex pheromone is regarded as a requisite for successful mating, uptake of specific PA(s) (lycopsamine-type PAs) is also imperative for the males to achieve copulation. The increase in the levels of two biogenic amines, octopamine and/or serotonin, in the brain and thoracic ganglia of males fed with specific PA(s) suggested that these alkaloids most likely enhance male mating activity. The results can present new evidence for the evolutionary provenance of pharmacophagous acquisition of PAs in PA-adapted insects.},

	abstract = {Although plant-defense theory has long predicted patterns of chemical defense across taxa, we know remarkably little about the evolution of defense, especially in the context of directional phylogenetic trends. Here we contrast the production of phenolics and cardenolides in 35 species of milkweeds (Asclepias and Gomphocarpus). Maximum-likelihood analyses of character evolution revealed three major patterns. First, consistent with the defense-escalation hypothesis, the diversification of the milkweeds was associated with a trend for increasing phenolic production; this pattern was reversed (a declining evolutionary trend) for cardenolides, toxins sequestered by specialist herbivores. Second, phylogenetically independent correlations existed among phenolic classes across species. For example, coumaric acid derivatives showed negatively correlated evolution with caffeic acid derivatives, and this was likely driven by the fact that the former are used as precursors for the latter. In contrast, coumaric acid derivatives were positively correlated with flavonoids, consistent with competition for the precursor p-coumaric acid. Finally, of the phenolic classes, only flavonoids showed correlated evolution (positive) with cardenolides, consistent with a physiological and evolutionary link between the two via malonate. Thus, this study presents a rigorous test of the defense-escalation hypothesis and a novel phylogenetic approach to understanding the long-term persistence of physiological constraints on secondary metabolism.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is general agreement that proteins eluting from different natural rubber latex products can cause immediate type hypersensitivity reactions in latex-allergic patients. However, there is as yet no consensus as to what are the most important allergens in natural rubber latex. OBJECTIVE: We wanted to purify and characterize at the primary structure level three natural latex proteins, suggested to represent significant allergens. METHODS: Proteins were purified from ultracentrifuged bottom fraction of natural rubber latex using high performance liquid chromatography gel filtration and reversed phase chromatography. Purified proteins were subjected to tryptic cleavage, peptide separation and amino acid sequencing. Immunoblotting was used to demonstrate IgE antibodies to the purified proteins in sera from latex-allergic patients. RESULTS: A 20 kDa protein was identified by amino acid sequencing as prohevein, a major protein in the rubber tree Hevea brasiliensis, and a 30 kDa natural rubber latex protein as hevamine, another essential rubber tree protein. A third, previously undescribed natural rubber latex protein, showed high homology to several plant endo-1,3-beta-glucosidases. In immunoblotting, the purified prohevein bound IgE antibodies from 24/29 (83\%) sera of latex-allergic patients including positive results in 4/6 latex-allergic children with spina bifida or other congenital anomalies. The purified prohevein elicited positive skin-prick test reactions in all six latex-allergic patients showing IgE to prohevein. The purified 36 kDa protein bound IgE from 6/29 (21\%) latex-allergic sera, and the purified hevamine from only 1/29 patient sera. CONCLUSION: The observed high frequency of IgE antibodies to prohevein suggests that this protein is a major natural rubber latex allergen.},

	abstract = {As the basal resource in most food webs, plants have evolved myriad strategies to battle consumption by herbivores. Over the past 50 years, plant defense theories have been formulated to explain the remarkable variation in abundance, distribution, and diversity of secondary chemistry and other defensive traits. For example, classic theories of enemy-driven evolutionary dynamics have hypothesized that defensive traits escalate through the diversification process. Despite the fact that macroevolutionary patterns are an explicit part of defense theories, phylogenetic analyses have not been previously attempted to disentangle specific predictions concerning (i) investment in resistance traits, (ii) recovery after damage, and (iii) plant growth rate. We constructed a molecular phylogeny of 38 species of milkweed and tested four major predictions of defense theory using maximum-likelihood methods. We did not find support for the growth-rate hypothesis. Our key finding was a pattern of phyletic decline in the three most potent resistance traits (cardenolides, latex, and trichomes) and an escalation of regrowth ability. Our neontological approach complements more common paleontological approaches to discover directional trends in the evolution of life and points to the importance of natural enemies in the macroevolution of species. The finding of macroevolutionary escalating regowth ability and declining resistance provides a window into the ongoing coevolutionary dynamics between plants and herbivores and suggests a revision of classic plant defense theory. Where plants are primarily consumed by specialist herbivores, regrowth (or tolerance) may be favored over resistance traits during the diversification process.},

In contrast to their preclinical efficacy, only a small subset of patients responds to FTIs.

They perform several important functions in plants and humans (e.g., carotenoids function as accessory pigments for light harvesting and provide photoprotection and pigmentation in plants). Monoterpenes and diterpenes, which are the main components of essential oils, act as allelopathic agents, attractants in plant-plant or plant-pathogen/herbivore interactions or repellants. For humans, carotenoids play an important role for health, carotenoids with provitamin A activity are important for vision; other carotenoids influence the human immune function and gap-junctional communication (GJC). Additionally, their antioxidative capacity is believed to be responsible for the health promoting properties of fruits and vegetables. Three main ways of antioxidant action of carotenoids have been detected until now (i.e., quenching of singlet oxygen, hydrogen transfer, or electron transfer). These mechanisms and investigation of antioxidant activity in vitro are discussed in detail. The monoterpenes limonene and perillyl alcohol may be promising substances in cancer therapy. Several investigations have studied the antioxidant activity of monoterpenes and diterpenes or essential oils in vitro. Results as well as the action of a newly discovered, very effective antioxidant (i.e., gamma-terpinene) are discussed. An important point when assessing the antioxidant activity of plant antioxidants is to consider their interaction with other antioxidants. Especially combinations of hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidants may exert synergistic effects, as has been shown for rutin in combination with gamma-terpinene, lutein, or lycopene.},

The functions of phenolic compounds in plant physiology and interactions with biotic and abiotic environments are difficult to overestimate. Phenolics play important roles in plant development, particularly in lignin and pigment biosynthesis. They also provide structural integrity and scaffolding support to plants. Importantly, phenolic phytoalexins, secreted by wounded or otherwise perturbed plants, repel or kill many microorganisms, and some pathogens can counteract or nullify these defences or even subvert them to their own advantage. In this review, we discuss the roles of phenolics in the interactions of plants with Agrobacterium and Rhizobium.},

Natural dyes are derived from natural resources; these are broadly classified as plant, animal, mineral, and microbialdyes. Natural dyes can be used for dyeing almost all types of natural fibers. Recent research shows that they can also be used to dye some synthetic fibers. Apart from their application in textiles, natural dyes are also used in the coloration of food, medicines, handicraft articles, and in leather processing, and many of the dye yielding plants are used as medicines in various traditional medicinal therapies.

Of 108Asclepias species in North America, monarchs are known to feed as larvae on 27. Research on 11 of these has shown that monarchs sequester cardenolides most effectively, to an asymptote of approximately 350 μg/0.1 g dry butterfly, from plants with intermediate cardenolide contents rather than from those with very high or very low cardenolide contents. SinceAsclepias host plant species are distributed widely in space and time across the continent, monarchs exploit them by migration between breeding and overwintering areas. After overwintering in central Mexico, spring migrants east of the Rocky Mountains exploit three predominantAsclepias species in the southern USA that have moderately high cardenolide contents. Monarchs sequester cardenolides very effectively from these species. First generation butterflies are thus well protected against predators and continue the migration north. Across the northern USA and southern Canada most summer breeding occurs on a fourthAsclepias species and in autumn most of these monarchs migrate back to Mexican overwintering sites. The ecological implications of this cycle of cardenolide sequestration for the evolution of monarch migration are discussed.},

Because of the mode of extraction, mostly by distillation from aromatic plants, they contain a variety of volatile molecules such as terpenes and terpenoids, phenol-derived aromatic components and aliphatic components. In vitro physicochemical assays characterise most of them as antioxidants. However, recent work shows that in eukaryotic cells, essential oils can act as prooxidants affecting inner cell membranes and organelles such as mitochondria. Depending on type and concentration, they exhibit cytotoxic effects on living cells but are usually non-genotoxic. In some cases, changes in intracellular redox potential and mitochondrial dysfunction induced by essential oils can be associated with their capacity to exert antigenotoxic effects. These findings suggest that, at least in part, the encountered beneficial effects of essential oils are due to prooxidant effects on the cellular level.},

	abstract = {Plants respond to herbivory through various morphological, biochemicals, and molecular mechanisms to counter/offset the effects of herbivore attack. The biochemical mechanisms of defense against the herbivores are wide-ranging, highly dynamic, and are mediated both by direct and indirect defenses. The defensive compounds are either produced constitutively or in response to plant damage, and affect feeding, growth, and survival of herbivores. In addition, plants also release volatile organic compounds that attract the natural enemies of the herbivores. These strategies either act independently or in conjunction with each other. However, our understanding of these defensive mechanisms is still limited. Induced resistance could be exploited as an important tool for the pest management to minimize the amounts of insecticides used for pest control. Host plant resistance to insects, particularly, induced resistance, can also be manipulated with the use of chemical elicitors of secondary metabolites, which confer resistance to insects. By understanding the mechanisms of induced resistance, we can predict the herbivores that are likely to be affected by induced responses. The elicitors of induced responses can be sprayed on crop plants to build up the natural defense system against damage caused by herbivores. The induced responses can also be engineered genetically, so that the defensive compounds are constitutively produced in plants against are challenged by the herbivory. Induced resistance can be exploited for developing crop cultivars, which readily produce the inducible response upon mild infestation, and can act as one of components of integrated pest management for sustainable crop production.},

In consequence, there is interest in new active ingredients as alternatives to conventional insecticides. Essential oils (EO) are potential tools for controlling M. domestica because of their effectiveness and their minimal environmental effects. In a fumigant assay, M. domestica adults treated with Minthostachys verticillata EO [LC50=0.5mg/dm3; majority components by SPME-GC: (4R)(+)-pulegone (67.5\%), menthone (22.3\%) and (4R)(+)-limonene (3.8\%)], died within 15min or less. The terpenes absorbed by the flies and their metabolites, analyzed using SPME fiber, were (4R)(+)-limonene (LC50=6.2mg/dm3), menthone (LC50=1.9mg/dm3), (4R)(+)-pulegone (LC50=1.7mg/dm3) and a new component, menthofuran (LC50=0.3mg/dm3), in a relative proportion of 12.4, 6.5, 35.9 and 44.2\% respectively. Menthofuran was formed by oxidation of either (4R)(+)-pulegone or menthone mediated by cytochrome P450, as demonstrated by a fumigation assay on flies previously treated with piperonyl butoxide, a P450 inhibitor, which showed a decrease in toxicity of the EO, (4R)(+)-pulegone and of menthone, supporting the participation of the P450 oxidizing system in the formation of menthofuran. The enzymatic reaction of isolated fly microsomes with the EO or the (4R)(+)-pulegone produced menthofuran in both cases. Contrary to expectations, the insect detoxification system contributed to enhance the toxicity of the M. verticillata EO. Consequently, resistant strains overexpressing P450 genes will be more susceptible to either M. verticillata EO or (4R)(+)-pulegone and menthone.},

To address this, we investigated insecticidal activities of lemongrass oil and citral, as well as the metabolism of citral in larvae of the cabbage looper, Trichoplusia ni, in associations with well-known enzyme inhibitors. Among the inhibitors tested, piperonyl butoxide showed the highest increase in toxicity followed by triphenyl phosphate, but no synergistic interaction between the inhibitors was observed. Topical application of citral to fifth instar larvae produced mild reductions in food consumption, and frass analysis after 24h revealed geranic acid (99.7\%) and neric acid (98.8\%) as major metabolites of citral. Neither citral nor any other metabolites were found following in vivo analysis of larvae after 24h, and no significant effect of enzyme inhibitors was observed on diet consumption or citral metabolism.},

Herbivore induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) and their effects on the third trophic level that involves predators and parasitoids are discussed. The fact that plants are not passive individuals is confirmed on the basis of several studies. Plants can perceive and respond to cues in their environments with plastic morphological, physiological and behavioral traits. Plasticity allows plants to tailor their defenses to their current and expected risks caused by herbivores. The "cry for help" of plants is also observed from the carnivores' point of view. The volatile mixture contains crucial information for decisions of carnivorous insects. Furthermore, the most important methods to examine the behavioral response of carnivorous insects to HIPVs are presented not only in laboratory set ups but also in the field. Manipulations of plants by silencing genes or over-expressing genes can help to understand mechanisms of indirect defense. Various interesting examples of indirect defense reveal the possibility to use HIPVs in biological control. Therefore, the application of synthetic pesticides, that pollute the environment, may be reduced in the future.},

The major plant families from which EOs are extracted include Myrtaceae, Lauraceae, Lamiaceae, and Asteraceae. EOs have repellent, insecticidal, and growth-reducing effects on a variety of insects. They have been used effectively to control preharvest and postharvest phytophagous insects and as insect repellents for biting flies and for home and garden insects. The compounds exert their activities on insects through neurotoxic effects involving several mechanisms, notably through GABA, octopamine synapses, and the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase. With a few exceptions, their mammalian toxicity is low and environmental persistence is short. Registration has been the main bottleneck in putting new products on the market, but more EOs have been approved for use in the United States than elsewhere owing to reduced-risk processes for these materials.},

	abstract = {Flavonoids and nitrogenous metabolites such as alkaloids, terpenoids, peptides and amino acids are major components of plant seeds. Conjugated forms of these compounds are soluble in water, and therefore, are easily released as chemical signals following imbibition. Once in the soil, these metabolites are first in line to serve as eco-sensing signals for suitable rhizobia and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal partners required for the establishment of symbiotic mutualisms. They may also serve as defence molecules against pathogens and insect pests, as well as playing a role in the control of parasitic members of the family Scrophulariaceae, especially Striga, a major plant pest of cereal crops in Africa. Seed metabolites such as flavonoids, alkaloids, terpenoids, peptides and amino acids define seedling growth and, ultimately, crop yields. Thus, an improvement in our understanding of seed chemistry would permit manipulation of these molecules for effective control of pathogens, insect pests, Striga and destructive weeds, as well as for enhanced acquisition of N and P via symbioses with soil rhizobia and AM fungi.},

The importance of varied functions in the origin of pathways with a series of sequential steps leading to end-products is considered; it is argued that the initial function is that of an internal regulatory agent, rather than as a filter against ultraviolet irradiation. The basic synthases, hydroxylases, and reductases of flavonoid pathways are presumed to have evolved from enzymes of primary metabolism. A speculative scheme is presented of flavonoid evolution within a primitive group of algae derived from a Charophycean rather than a Chlorophycean line, as a land environment was invaded. Flavonoid evolution was preceded by that of the phenylpropanoid and malonyl-coenzyme A pathways, but evolved prior to the lignin pathway.},

	abstract = {Plants (land plants, embryophytes) are of monophyletic origin from a freshwater ancestor that, if still extant, would be classified among the charophycean green algae. Plants, but not charophyceans, possess a life history involving alternation of two morphologically distinct developmentally associated bodies, sporophyte and gametophyte. Body plan evolution in plants has involved fundamental changes in the forms of both gametophyte and sporophyte and the evolutionary origin of regulatory systems that generate different body plans in sporophytes and gametophytes of the same species. Comparative analysis, based on molecular phylogenetic information, identifies fundamental body plan features that originated during radiation of charophycean algae and were inherited by plants. These include, in probable evolutionary order: cellulosic cell wall, multicellular body, cytokinetic phragmoplast, plasmodesmata, apical meristematic cell, apical cell proliferation (branching), three-dimensional tissues, asymmetric cell division, cell specialization capacity, zygote retention, and placenta. Body plan features whose origin is linked to the dawn of plants include: multicellular sporophyte body, histogenetic apical meristem in the gametophyte body, and capacity for tissue differentiation in both sporophyte and gametophyte. Origin of a well-defined sporophytic apical stem cell and a system for its proliferation, correlated with capacity for organ production and branching, occurred sometime between the divergence of modern bryophytes and vascular plant lineages. Roots and their meristem and a multilayered tunica-corpus shoot apical meristem arose later. Regulatory genes affecting shoot meristems, which have been detected by analysis of higher plant mutants, may be relevant to understanding early plant body plan transitions. Fundamental aspects of the plant body plan are remarkably consistent within the plant kingdom and are different from metazoans. All plants exhibit at least one form of apical meristem consisting of one or more cells that are …},

Recent advances in the understanding of the regulation of phenolic synthesis raises the question as to whether between-site and temporal variation in the amount and type of plants phenolics is due mostly to selection pressure by herbivores.

	abstract = {During their evolution, plants have acquired the ability to produce a huge variety of compounds. Unlike the specialized metabolites that accumulate in limited numbers of species, flavonoids are widely distributed in the plant kingdom. Therefore, a detailed analysis of flavonoid metabolism in genomics and metabolomics is an ideal way to investigate how plants have developed their unique metabolic pathways during the process of evolution. More comprehensive and precise metabolite profiling integrated with genomic information are helpful to emerge unexpected gene functions and/or pathways. The distribution of flavonoids and their biosynthetic genes in the plant kingdom suggests that flavonoid biosynthetic pathways evolved through a series of steps. The enzymes that form the flavonoid scaffold structures probably first appeared by recruitment of enzymes from primary metabolic pathways, and later, enzymes that belong to superfamilies such as 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase, cytochrome P450, and short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase modified and varied the structures. It is widely accepted that the first two enzymes in flavonoid biosynthesis, chalcone synthase and chalcone isomerase, were derived from common ancestors with enzymes in lipid metabolism. Later enzymes acquired their function by gene duplication and the subsequent acquisition of new functions. In this review, we describe the recent progress in metabolomics technologies for flavonoids and the evolution of flavonoid skeleton biosynthetic enzymes to understand the complicate evolutionary traits of flavonoid metabolism in plant kingdom.},

The primary function of flavonoids in the interaction is to induce transcription of the genes for biosynthesis of the rhizobial signaling molecules called Nod factors, which are perceived by the plant to allow symbiotic infection of the root. Many legumes produce specific flavonoids that only induce Nod factor production in homologous rhizobia, and therefore act as important determinants of host range. Despite a wealth of evidence on legume flavonoids, relatively few have proven roles in rhizobial infection. Recent studies suggest that production of key "infection" flavonoids is highly localized at infection sites. Furthermore, some of the flavonoids being produced at infection sites are phytoalexins and may have a role in the selection of compatible symbionts during infection. The molecular details of how flavonoid production in plants is regulated during nodulation have not yet been clarified, but nitrogen availability has been shown to play a role.},

While the medical field has noticed flavonoids for their potential antioxidant, anticancer and cardioprotectant characteristics, growers and processors in plant sciences have utilized flavonoid biosynthesis and the genetic manipulation of the flavonoid pathway in plants to improve the nutritional and ornamental value of crops. Flavonoids: Chemistry, Biochemistry and Applications covers each class of flavonoid and presents the historic advances made in flavonoid research since the 1994 publication of an earlier text, Flavonoids Advances in Research Since 1986. This book details the analytical techniques scientists have used to achieve an improved understanding of flavonoid structures and functions as well as advances in the genetic manipulation of the flavonoid pathway, and the discovery of many new flavonoids. It indicates which techniques are best suited for the isolation and structure determination of flavonoids and whether the structures are novel. While explaining how to evaluate the flavonoid content in food and beverages, the book reveals the biotechnological advances that have allowed nutritionists and plant physiologists to assess the possible effects of flavonoids. As interest regarding the impact and health benefits of flavonoids continues to grow, Flavonoids: Chemistry, Biochemistry and Applications reflects the continuing commitment of flavonoid researchers to the improvement of human health and provides the most comprehensive, up-to-date source of information for all known flavonoids."–Publisher's website.},

We have previously shown that concentrations of polyphen-ols in P. muricata foliage vary along an extreme soil acidity/ fertility gradient3. Apparently this feedback to soil conditions controls the dominant form in which litter nitrogen is mobilized, facilitating nitrogen recovery through pine-mycorrhizal associations, minimizing nitrogen availability to competing organisms, and attenuating nitrogen losses from leaching and denitrification. Polyphenol control of nitrogen dynamics helps explain the convergent evolution of tannin-rich plant communities on highly leached soils.},

Despite the large number of potential targets for modulating cardenolide sensitivity, amino acid substitutions associated with host-plant specialization are highly clustered, with many parallel substitutions. Additionally, we document four independent duplications of ATPα with convergent tissue-specific expression patterns. We find that unique substitutions are disproportionately associated with recent duplications relative to parallel substitutions.

We studied the evolution of pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) in Apocynaceae, larval host plants for PA-adapted butterflies (Danainae, milkweed and clearwing butterflies), to test if the evolutionary pattern is consistent with de-escalation. We used the first PA biosynthesis specific enzyme (homospermidine synthase, HSS) as tool for reconstructing PA evolution. We found hss orthologues in diverse Apocynaceae species, not all of them known to produce PAs. The phylogenetic analysis showed a monophyletic origin of the putative hss sequences early in the evolution of one Apocynaceae lineage (the APSA clade). We found an hss pseudogene in Asclepias syriaca, a species known to produce cardiac glycosides but no PAs, and four losses of an HSS amino acid motif. APSA clade species are significantly more likely to be Danainae larval host plants than expected if all Apocynaceae species were equally likely to be exploited. Our findings are consistent with PA de-escalation as an adaptive response to specialist attack.},

These alkaloids exhibit strong hepatotoxic, genotoxic, cytotoxic, tumorigenic, and neurotoxic activities, and thereby pose a serious threat to the health of humans since they are known contaminants of foods including grain, milk, honey, and eggs, as well as plant derived pharmaceuticals and food supplements. Livestock and fodder can be affected due to PA-containing plants on pastures and fields. Despite their importance as toxic contaminants of agricultural products, there is limited knowledge about their biosynthesis. While the intermediates were well defined by feeding experiments, only one enzyme involved in PA biosynthesis has been characterized so far, the homospermidine synthase catalyzing the first committed step in PA biosynthesis. This review gives an overview about structural diversity of PAs, biosynthetic pathways of necine base, and necic acid formation and how PA accumulation is regulated. Furthermore, we discuss their role in plant ecology and their modes of toxicity towards humans and animals. Finally, several examples of PA-producing crop plants are discussed.},

From a human physiological standpoint, phenolic compounds are vital in defense responses, such as anti-aging, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-proliferative activities. Therefore, it is beneficial to eat such plant foods that have a high antioxidant compound content, which will cut down the incidence of certain chronic diseases, for instance diabetes, cancers and cardiovascular diseases, through the management of oxidative stress. Furthermore, berries and other fruits with low-amylase and high-glucosidase inhibitory activities could be thought of as candidate food items in the control of the early stages of hyperglycemia associated with type 2 diabetes.},

In spite of the fact that the phenylpropanoids and their derivatives are sometimes classified as secondary metabolites, their relevance to plant survival has been made clear via the study of Arabidopsis and other plant species. As a model system, Arabidopsis has helped to elucidate many details of the phenylpropanoid pathway, its enzymes and intermediates, and the interconnectedness of the pathway with plant metabolism as a whole. These advances in our understanding have been made possible in large part by the relative ease with which mutations can be generated, identified, and studied in Arabidopsis. Herein, we provide an overview of the research progress that has been made in recent years, emphasizing both the genes (and gene families) associated with the phenylpropanoid pathway in Arabidopsis, and the end products that have contributed to the identification of many mutants deficient in the phenylpropanoid metabolism: the sinapate esters.},

The aromatic amino acids are synthesized via the shikimate pathway followed by the branched aromatic amino acid metabolic pathway, with chorismate serving as a major branch point intermediate metabolite. Yet, the regulation of their synthesis is still far from being understood. So far, only three enzymes in this pathway, namely, chorismate mutase of phenylalanine and tyrosine synthesis, tryptophan synthase of tryptophan biosynthesis and arogenate dehydratase of phenylalanine biosynthesis, proved experimentally to be allosterically regulated. The major biosynthesis route of phenylalanine in plants occurs via arogenate. Yet, recent studies suggest that an alternative route of phynylalanine biosynthesis via phenylpyruvate may also exist in plants, similarly to many microorganisms. Several transcription factors regulating the expression of genes encoding enzymes of both the shikimate pathway and aromatic amino acid metabolism have also been recently identified in Arabidopsis and other plant species.},

As these modifications alter the stability, solubility, and activity of the BAs, they impact the functional roles of these molecules.

Flavonoids are now considered as an indispensable component in a variety of nutraceutical, pharmaceutical, medicinal and cosmetic applications. This is attributed to their anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, anti-mutagenic and anti-carcinogenic properties coupled with their capacity to modulate key cellular enzyme function. Research on flavonoids received an added impulse with the discovery of the low cardiovascular mortality rate and also prevention of CHD. Information on the working mechanisms of flavonoids is still not understood properly. However, it has widely been known for centuries that derivatives of plant origin possess a broad spectrum of biological activity. Current trends of research and development activities on flavonoids relate to isolation, identification, characterisation and functions of flavonoids and finally their applications on health benefits. Molecular docking and knowledge of bioinformatics are also being used to predict potential applications and manufacturing by industry.

Although it has long been recognized that plants, bacteria, and fungi synthesize and accumulate GA, the pathway leading to its synthesis was largely unknown. Here we provide evidence that shikimate dehydrogenase (SDH), a shikimate pathway enzyme essential for aromatic amino acid synthesis, is also required for GA production. Escherichia coli (E. coli) aroE mutants lacking a functional SDH can be complemented with the plant enzyme such that they grew on media lacking aromatic amino acids and produced GA in vitro. Transgenic Nicotiana tabacum lines expressing a Juglans regia SDH exhibited a 500\% increase in GA accumulation. The J. regia and E. coli SDH was purified via overexpression in E. coli and used to measure substrate and cofactor kinetics, following reduction of NADP(+) to NADPH. Reversed-phase liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray mass spectrometry (RP-LC/ESI-MS) was used to quantify and validate GA production through dehydrogenation of 3-dehydroshikimate (3-DHS) by purified E. coli and J. regia SDH when shikimic acid (SA) or 3-DHS were used as substrates and NADP(+) as cofactor.

In nature, gallic acid and its derivatives are present in nearly every part of the plant, such as bark, wood, leaf, fruit, root and seed. They are present in different concentrations in common foodstuffs such as blueberry, blackberry, strawberry, plums, grapes, mango, cashew nut, hazelnut, walnut, tea, wine and so on. After consumption, about 70\% of gallic acid is adsorbed and then excreted in the urine as 4-O-methylgallic acid. Differently, the ester derivatives of gallic acid, such as catechin gallate ester or gallotannins, are hydrolyzed to gallic acid before being metabolized to methylated derivatives. Gallic acid is a well known antioxidant compounds which has neuroprotective actions in different models of neurodegeneration, neurotoxicity and oxidative stress. In this review, we discuss about the neuroprotective actions of gallic acid and derivatives and their potential mechanisms of action.},

In the past decade, coumarins have emerged as iron-mobilizing compounds that are secreted by plant roots and aid in iron uptake from iron-deprived soils. Members of the coumarin family are found in many plant species. Besides their role in iron uptake, coumarins have been extensively studied for their potential to fight infections in both plants and animals. Coumarin activities range from antimicrobial and antiviral to anticoagulant and anticancer. In recent years, studies in the model plant species tobacco and Arabidopsis have significantly increased our understanding of coumarin biosynthesis, accumulation, secretion, chemical modification and their modes of action against plant pathogens. Here, we review current knowledge on coumarins in different plant species. We focus on simple coumarins and provide an overview on their biosynthesis and role in environmental stress responses, with special attention for the recently discovered semiochemical role of coumarins in aboveground and belowground plant-microbe interactions and the assembly of the root microbiome.},

	abstract = {Plant developmental processes are controlled by internal signals that depend on the adequate supply of mineral nutrients by soil to roots. Thus, the availability of nutrient elements can be a major constraint to plant growth in many environments of the world, especially the tropics where soils are extremely low in nutrients. Plants take up most mineral nutrients through the rhizosphere where micro-organisms interact with plant products in root exudates. Plant root exudates consist of a complex mixture of organic acid anions, phytosiderophores, sugars, vitamins, amino acids, purines, nucleosides, inorganic ions (e.g. HCO3−, OH−, H+), gaseous molecules (CO2, H2), enzymes and root border cells which have major direct or indirect effects on the acquisition of mineral nutrients required for plant growth. Phenolics and aldonic acids exuded directly by roots of N2-fixing legumes serve as major signals to Rhizobiaceae bacteria which form root nodules where N2 is reduced to ammonia. Some of the same compounds affect development of mycorrhizal fungi that are crucial for phosphate uptake. Plants growing in low-nutrient environments also employ root exudates in ways other than as symbiotic signals to soil microbes involved in nutrient procurement. Extracellular enzymes release P from organic compounds, and several types of molecules increase iron availability through chelation. Organic acids from root exudates can solubilize unavailable soil Ca, Fe and Al phosphates. Plants growing on nitrate generally maintain electronic neutrality by releasing an excess of anions, including hydroxyl ions. Legumes, which can grow well without nitrate through the benefits of N2 reduction in the root nodules, must release a net excess of protons. These protons can markedly lower rhizosphere pH and decrease the availability of some mineral nutrients as well as the effective functioning of some soil bacteria, such as the rhizobial bacteria themselves. Thus, environments which are naturally very acidic can pose a challenge to nutrient acquisition by plant roots, and threaten the survival of many beneficial microbes including the roots themselves. A few plants such as Rooibos tea (Aspalathus linearis L.) actively modify their rhizosphere pH by extruding OH− and HCO3− to facilitate growth in low pH soils (pH 3 – 5). Our current understanding of how plants use root exudates to modify rhizosphere pH and the potential benefits associated with such processes are assessed in this review.},

The structural diversity found in this family of compounds led to the division into different categories, from simple coumarins to many other kinds of policyclic coumarins, such as furocoumarins and pyranocoumarins. Simple coumarins and analogues are a large class of compounds that have attracted their interest for a long time due to their biological activities: they have shown to be useful as antitumoural, anti-HIV agents and as CNS-active compounds. Furthermore, they have been reported to have multiple biological activities (anticoagulant, anti-inflammatory), although all these properties have not been evaluated systematically. In addition, their enzyme inhibition properties, antimicrobial and antioxidant activities are other foremost topics of this field of research. The present work is to survey the information published or abstracted from 1990 till 2003, which is mainly related to the occurrence, synthesis and biological importance of simple coumarins and some analogues, such as biscoumarins and triscoumarins.

This hypothesis is experimentally demonstrated here by resurrecting ancestral fungal peroxidases, after sequence reconstruction from genomes of extant white-rot Polyporales, and evaluating their oxidative attack on the lignin polymer by state-of-the-art analytical techniques. Rapid stopped-flow estimation of the transient-state constants for the 2 successive one-electron transfers from lignin to the peroxide-activated enzyme (k2app and k3app) showed a progressive increase during peroxidase evolution (up to 50-fold higher values for the rate-limiting k3app). The above agreed with 2-dimensional NMR analyses during steady-state treatments of hardwood lignin, showing that its degradation (estimated from the normalized aromatic signals of lignin units compared with a control) and syringyl-to-guaiacyl ratio increased with the enzyme evolutionary distance from the first peroxidase ancestor. More interestingly, the stopped-flow estimations of electron transfer rates also showed how the most recent peroxidase ancestors that already incorporated the exposed tryptophan into their molecular structure (as well as the extant lignin peroxidase) were comparatively more efficient at oxidizing hardwood (angiosperm) lignin, while the most ancestral “tryptophanless” enzymes were more efficient at abstracting electrons from softwood (conifer) lignin. A time calibration of the ancestry of Polyporales peroxidases localized the appearance of the first peroxidase with a solvent-exposed catalytic tryptophan to 194 ± 70 Mya, coincident with the diversification of angiosperm plants characterized by the appearance of dimethoxylated syringyl lignin units.},

	abstract = {Dating Wood Rot Specific lineages within the basidiomycete fungi, white rot species, have evolved the ability to break up a major structural component of woody plants, lignin, relative to their non–lignin-decaying brown rot relatives. Through the deep phylogenetic sampling of fungal genomes, Floudas et al. (p. 1715; see the Perspective by Hittinger) mapped the detailed evolution of wood-degrading enzymes. A key peroxidase and other enzymes involved in lignin decay were present in the common ancestor of the Agaricomycetes. These genes then expanded through gene duplications in parallel, giving rise to white rot lineages. Wood is a major pool of organic carbon that is highly resistant to decay, owing largely to the presence of lignin. The only organisms capable of substantial lignin decay are white rot fungi in the Agaricomycetes, which also contains non–lignin-degrading brown rot and ectomycorrhizal species. Comparative analyses of 31 fungal genomes (12 generated for this study) suggest that lignin-degrading peroxidases expanded in the lineage leading to the ancestor of the Agaricomycetes, which is reconstructed as a white rot species, and then contracted in parallel lineages leading to brown rot and mycorrhizal species. Molecular clock analyses suggest that the origin of lignin degradation might have coincided with the sharp decrease in the rate of organic carbon burial around the end of the Carboniferous period.

The development of lignin biosynthesis has been considered to be one of the key factors that allowed land plants to flourish in terrestrial ecosystems. Lignin provides structural rigidity for tracheophytes to stand upright, and strengthens the cell wall of their water-conducting tracheary elements to withstand the negative pressure generated during transpiration. In this review, we discuss a number of aspects regarding the origin and evolution of lignin biosynthesis during land plant evolution, including the establishment of its monomer biosynthetic scaffold, potential precursors to the lignin polymer, as well as the emergence of the polymerization machinery and regulatory system. The accumulated knowledge on the topic, as summarized here, provides us with an evolutionary view on how this complex metabolic system emerged and developed.},

	abstract = {Establishing the timescale of early land plant evolution is essential for testing hypotheses on the coevolution of land plants and Earth's System. The sparseness of early land plant megafossils and stratigraphic controls on their distribution make the fossil record an unreliable guide, leaving only the molecular clock. However, the application of molecular clock methodology is challenged by the current impasse in attempts to resolve the evolutionary relationships among the living bryophytes and tracheophytes. Here, we establish a timescale for early land plant evolution that integrates over topological uncertainty by exploring the impact of competing hypotheses on bryophyte-tracheophyte relationships, among other variables, on divergence time estimation. We codify 37 fossil calibrations for Viridiplantae following best practice. We apply these calibrations in a Bayesian relaxed molecular clock analysis of a phylogenomic dataset encompassing the diversity of Embryophyta and their relatives within Viridiplantae. Topology and dataset sizes have little impact on age estimates, with greater differences among alternative clock models and calibration strategies. For all analyses, a Cambrian origin of Embryophyta is recovered with highest probability. The estimated ages for crown tracheophytes range from Late Ordovician to late Silurian. This timescale implies an early establishment of terrestrial ecosystems by land plants that is in close accord with recent estimates for the origin of terrestrial animal lineages. Biogeochemical models that are constrained by the fossil record of early land plants, or attempt to explain their impact, must consider the implications of a much earlier, middle Cambrian-Early Ordovician, origin.},

	abstract = {The combination of immunodeficiency, inflammatory process and nutritional status that is characteristic of infective and food-borne illness is more evident in chronic diet- and environment-influenced chronic diseases such as diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, cancer, arthritis and neuro-degeneration diseases. These chronic diseases tend to be oxidation-linked and may manifest in communities around the world, irrespective of income. In addressing the challenges of the above diseases, a significant role for dietary phytochemicals is emerging. Phytochemicals are required from a spectrum of food for at least their antioxidant role, if not for other properties, to protect tissues from activities that manifest themselves into what we call chronic disease. Among the diverse groups of phytochemicals, phenolic antioxidants and antimicrobials from food plants are being targeted for designed dietary intervention to manage major oxidation-linked diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, arthritis, cognition diseases and cancer. Foods containing phenolic phytochemicals are also being targeted to manage bacterial infections associated with chronic diseases such as peptic ulcer, urinary tract infections, dental caries and food-borne bacterial infections. Plants produce phenolic metabolites as a part of growth, developmental and stress adaptation response. These stress and developmental responses are being harnessed to design consistent phytochemical profiles for safety and clinical relevancy using novel tissue culture and bioprocessing technologies. The biochemical strategy for harnessing phenolic phytochemicals for human health and wellness is based on the hypothesis that phenolic metabolites in plants are efficiently produced through an alternative mode of metabolism linking proline synthesis with pentose-phosphate pathway. In this model, stress-induced proline biosynthesis is coupled to pentose-phosphate pathway, driving the synthesis of NADPH(2) and sugar phosphates for anabolic pathways, including phenolic and antioxidant response pathways, while simultaneously providing reducing equivalents needed for mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in the form of proline as an alternative to NADH from Krebs/TCA cycle. Based on this model, tissue culture techniques and elicitation concepts have been used to stimulate phenolic metabolites with an antioxidant response in germinating seeds, sprouts and clonal lines of dietary plants. From our initial investigations, a model has been proposed in which the proline-linked pentose-phosphate pathway is suggested to be critical for modulating protective antioxidant response pathways in diverse biological systems, including biochemical and cellular pathways important for human health. The proposed proline-linked pentose-phosphate pathway model provides a mechanism for understanding the mode of action of phenolic phytochemicals in modulating antioxidant pathways and provides avenues by which dietary approaches may manage oxidation-linked chronic and infectious diseases. The model also has implications for the development of antimicrobial phenolic phytochemicals against bacterial pathogens in an era of increasing antibiotic resistance. Further, this model also has relevance for improving fungal and yeast-based food bioprocessing for designing functional foods and for environmental bioremediation using plant and microbial systems, as well as for improving agricultural and food systems in harsh environments.},

EDS5 is homologous with members of the MATE (multidrug and toxin extrusion) transporter family. EDS5 expression is very low in unstressed plants and strongly induced by pathogens and UV-C light. The transcript starts to accumulate 2 hr after inoculation of Arabidopsis with an avirulent strain of Pseudomonas syringae or UV-C light exposure, and it stays induced for ∼2 days. EDS5 also is expressed after treatments with salicylic acid, indicating a possible positive feedback regulation. EDS5 expression after infection by certain pathogens as well as after UV-C light exposure depends on the pathogen response proteins EDS1, PAD4, and NDR1, indicating that the signal transduction pathways after UV-C light exposure and pathogen inoculation share common elements.},

This review surveys the mechanisms  involved in the biosynthesis and metabolism of this critical plant hormone. While a  complete biosynthetic route has yet to be established, stressed Arabidopsis appear  to synthesize SA primarily via an isochorismate-utilizing pathway in the  chloroplast. A distinct pathway utilizing phenylalanine as the substrate also may  contribute to SA accumulation, although to a much lesser extent. Once synthesized,  free SA levels can be regulated by a variety of chemical modifications. Many of  these modifications inactivate SA; however, some confer novel properties that may  aid in long distance SA transport or the activation of stress responses  complementary to those induced by free SA. In addition, a number of factors that  directly or indirectly regulate the expression of SA biosynthetic genes or that  influence the rate of SA catabolism have been identified. An integrated model,  encompassing current knowledge of SA metabolism in Arabidopsis, as well as the  influence other plant hormones exert on SA metabolism, is presented.},

	abstract = {Plastoquinone (PQ) and ubiquinone (UQ) are two important prenylquinones, functioning as electron transporters in the electron transport chain of oxygenic photosynthesis and the aerobic respiratory chain, respectively, and play indispensable roles in plant growth and development through participating in the biosynthesis and metabolism of important chemical compounds, acting as antioxidants, being involved in plant response to stress, and regulating gene expression and cell signal transduction. UQ, particularly UQ(10), has also been widely used in people's life. It is effective in treating cardiovascular diseases, chronic gingivitis and periodontitis, and shows favorable impact on cancer treatment and human reproductive health. PQ and UQ are made up of an active benzoquinone ring attached to a polyisoprenoid side chain. Biosynthesis of PQ and UQ is very complicated with more than thirty five enzymes involved. Their synthetic pathways can be generally divided into two stages. The first stage leads to the biosynthesis of precursors of benzene quinone ring and prenyl side chain. The benzene quinone ring for UQ is synthesized from tyrosine or phenylalanine, whereas the ring for PQ is derived from tyrosine. The prenyl side chains of PQ and UQ are derived from glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and pyruvate through the 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate pathway and/or acetyl-CoA and acetoacetyl-CoA through the mevalonate pathway. The second stage includes the condensation of ring and side chain and subsequent modification. Homogentisate solanesyltransferase, 4-hydroxybenzoate polyprenyl diphosphate transferase and a series of benzene quinone ring modification enzymes are involved in this stage. PQ exists in plants, while UQ widely presents in plants, animals and microbes. Many enzymes and their encoding genes involved in PQ and UQ biosynthesis have been intensively studied recently. Metabolic engineering of UQ(10) in plants, such as rice and tobacco, has also been tested. In this review, we summarize and discuss recent research progresses in the biosynthetic pathways of PQ and UQ and enzymes and their encoding genes involved in side chain elongation and in the second stage of PQ and UQ biosynthesis. Physiological functions of PQ and UQ played in plants as well as the practical application and metabolic engineering of PQ and UQ are also included.},

	abstract = {Biofilms, the communities of surface-attached bacteria embedded into extracellular matrix, are ubiquitous microbial consortia securing the effective resistance of constituent cells to environmental impacts and host immune responses. Biofilm-embedded bacteria are generally inaccessible for antimicrobials, therefore the disruption of biofilm matrix is the potent approach to eradicate microbial biofilms. We demonstrate here the destruction of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms with Ficin, a nonspecific plant protease. The biofilm thickness decreased two-fold after 24 hours treatment with Ficin at 10 μg/ml and six-fold at 1000 μg/ml concentration. We confirmed the successful destruction of biofilm structures and the significant decrease of non-specific bacterial adhesion to the surfaces after Ficin treatment using confocal laser scanning and atomic force microscopy. Importantly, Ficin treatment enhanced the effects of antibiotics on biofilms-embedded cells via disruption of biofilm matrices. Pre-treatment with Ficin (1000 μg/ml) considerably reduced the concentrations of ciprofloxacin and bezalkonium chloride required to suppress the viable Staphylococci by 3 orders of magnitude. We also demonstrated that Ficin is not cytotoxic towards human breast adenocarcinoma cells (MCF7) and dog adipose derived stem cells. Overall, Ficin is a potent tool for staphylococcal biofilm treatment and fabrication of novel antimicrobial therapeutics for medical and veterinary applications.},

	abstract = {Vitamin A (retinol) is ingested as either retinyl esters or carotenoids and metabolized to active compounds such as 11-cis-retinal, which is important for vision, and all-trans-retinoic acid, which is the primary mediator of biological actions of vitamin A. All-trans-retinoic acid binds to retinoic acid receptors (RARs), which heterodimerize with retinoid X receptors. RAR-retinoid X receptor heterodimers function as transcription factors, binding RAR-responsive elements in promoters of different genes. Numerous cellular functions, including bone cell functions, are mediated by vitamin A; however, it has long been recognized that increased levels of vitamin A can have deleterious effects on bone, resulting in increased skeletal fragility. Bone mass is dependent on the balance between bone resorption and bone formation. A decrease in bone mass may be caused by either an excess of resorption or decreased bone formation. Early studies indicated that the primary skeletal effect of vitamin A was to increase bone resorption, but later studies have shown that vitamin A can not only stimulate the formation of bone-resorbing osteoclasts but also inhibit their formation. Effects of vitamin A on bone formation have not been studied in as great a detail and are not as well characterized as effects on bone resorption. Several epidemiological studies have shown an association between vitamin A, decreased bone mass, and osteoporotic fractures, but the data are not conclusive because other studies have found no associations, and some studies have suggested that vitamin A primarily promotes skeletal health. In this presentation, we have summarized how vitamin A is absorbed and metabolized and how it functions intracellularly. Vitamin A deficiency and excess are introduced, and detailed descriptions of clinical and preclinical studies of the effects of vitamin A on the skeleton are presented.},

	abstract = {In animals, successful production of the visual chromophore (11-cis-retinal or derivatives thereof such as 11-cis-3-hydroxy-retinal) is essential for photoreceptor cell function and survival. These carotenoid-derived compounds must combine with a protein moiety (the opsin) to establish functional visual pigments. Evidence from cell culture systems has implicated that the retinal pigment epithelium protein of 65 kDa (RPE65) is the long-sought all-trans to 11-cis retinoid isomerase. RPE65 is structurally related to nonheme iron oxygenases that catalyze the conversion of carotenoids into retinoids. In vertebrate genomes, two carotenoid oxygenases and RPE65 are encoded, whereas in insect genomes only a single representative of this protein family, named NinaB (denoting neither inactivation nor afterpotential mutant B), is encoded. We here cloned and functionally characterized the ninaB gene from the great wax moth Galleria mellonella. We show that the recombinant purified enzyme combines isomerase and oxygenase (isomerooxygenase) activity in a single polypeptide. From kinetics and isomeric composition of cleavage products of asymmetrical carotenoid substrates, we propose a model for the spatial arrangement between substrate and enzyme. In Drosophila, we show that carotenoid-isomerooxygenase activity of NinaB is more generally found in insects, and we provide physiological evidence that carotenoids such as 11-cis-retinal can promote visual pigment biogenesis in the dark. Our study demonstrates that trans/cis isomerase activity can be intrinsic to this class of proteins and establishes these enzymes as key components for both invertebrate and vertebrate vision.},

We show here that, unlike other cytokine receptors, phosphorylation of STRA6 is not simply induced upon binding of its extracellular ligand. Instead, activation of the receptor is triggered by STRA6-mediated translocation of retinol from serum RBP to an intracellular acceptor, the retinol-binding protein CRBP-I. The observations also demonstrate that the movement of retinol from RBP to CRBP-I, and thus activation of STRA6, is critically linked to the intracellular metabolism of the vitamin. Furthermore, the data show that STRA6 phosphorylation is required for retinol uptake to proceed. Hence, the observations demonstrate that STRA6 orchestrates a multicomponent “machinery” that couples vitamin A homeostasis and metabolism to activation of a signaling cascade and that, in turn, STRA6 signaling regulates the cellular uptake of the vitamin. STRA6 appears to be a founding member of a new class of proteins that may be termed “cytokine signaling transporters.”},

Retinol circulates in blood bound to retinol-binding  protein (RBP) and is transported into cells by a membrane protein termed "stimulated  by retinoic acid 6" (STRA6). We show here that STRA6 not only is a vitamin A  transporter but also is a cell-surface signaling receptor activated by the  RBP-retinol complex. Association of RBP-retinol with STRA6 triggers tyrosine  phosphorylation, resulting in recruitment and activation of JAK2 and the  transcription factor STAT5. The RBP-retinol/STRA6/JAK2/STAT5 signaling cascade  induces the expression of STAT target genes, including suppressor of cytokine  signaling 3 (SOCS3), which inhibits insulin signaling, and peroxisome  proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), which enhances lipid accumulation.  These observations establish that the parental vitamin A molecule is a  transcriptional regulator in its own right, reveal that the scope of biological  functions of the vitamin is broader than previously suspected, and provide a  rationale for understanding how RBP and retinol regulate energy homeostasis and  insulin responses.},

	abstract = {Active vitamin A metabolites, known as retinoids, are essential for multiple physiological processes, ranging from vision to embryonic development. These small hydrophobic compounds associate in vivo with soluble proteins that are present in a variety of cells and in particular extracellular compartments, and which bind different types of retinoids with high selectivity and affinity. Traditionally, retinoid-binding proteins were viewed as transport proteins that act by solubilizing and protecting their labile ligands in aqueous spaces. It is becoming increasingly clear, however, that, in addition to this general role, retinoid-binding proteins have diverse and specific functions in regulating the disposition, metabolism and activities of retinoids. Some retinoid-binding proteins appear to act by sequestering their ligands, thereby generating concentration gradients that allow cells to take up retinoids from extracellular pools and metabolic steps to proceed in energetically unfavourable directions. Other retinoid-binding proteins regulate the metabolic fates of their ligands by protecting them from some enzymes while allowing metabolism by others. In these cases, delivery of a bound retinoid from the binding protein to the ‘correct’ enzyme is likely to be mediated by direct and specific interactions between the two proteins. One retinoid-binding protein was reported to enhance the ability of its ligand to regulate gene transcription by directly delivering this retinoid to the transcription factor that is activated by it. ‘Channelling’ of retinoids between their corresponding binding protein and a particular protein target thus seems to be a general theme through which some retinoid-binding proteins exert their effects.},

The ability to accumulate vitamin A stores lessens the need for  routinely consuming vitamin A in the diet, and this provides a selective advantage  to the organism. The molecular processes that underlie this selective advantage  include efficient mechanisms to acquire vitamin A from the diet, efficient and  overlapping mechanisms for the transport of vitamin A in the circulation, a specific  mechanism allowing for vitamin A storage, and a mechanism for mobilizing vitamin A  from these stores in response to tissue needs.

	abstract = {The eye needs to biosynthesize 11-cis-retinoids because the chromophore of rhodopsin is 11-cis-retinal. The critical metabolic step is the endergonic isomerization of free all-trans-retinol (vitamin A) into 11-cis-retinol. This isomerization process can take place in isolated membranes from the retinal pigment epithelium in the absence of added energy sources. Specific binding proteins probably do not serve as an energy source, and since all of the reactions in the visual cycle are shown here to be reversible, trapping reactions also do not participate in the isomerization reaction. One previously unexplored possibility is that the chemical energy in the bonds of the membrane itself may drive the isomerization reaction. A group transfer reaction is proposed that forms a retinyl ester from a lipid acyl donor and vitamin A. This transfer can drive the isomerization reaction because the all-trans-retinyl ester is isomerized directly to 11-cis-retinol. Thus, the free energy of hydrolysis of the ester is coupled to the thermodynamically uphill trans to cis isomerization. The prediction of an obligate C-O bond cleavage in the vitamin A moiety during isomerization is borne out. Although the natural substrate for isomerization is not known, all-trans-retinyl palmitate is processed in vitro to 11-cis-retinol by pigment epithelial membranes.},

Bovine and human prRDH are highly  homologous and are most closely related to 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1.  The enzymatic properties of recombinant bovine prRDH closely match those previously  reported for RDH activity in crude bovine rod outer segment preparations. In situ  hybridization and RNA blotting show that the PRRDH gene is expressed specifically in  photoreceptor cells, and protein blotting and immunocytochemistry show that prRDH  localizes exclusively to both rod and cone outer segments and that prRDH is tightly  associated with outer segment membranes. Taken together, these data indicate that  prRDH is the enzyme responsible for the reduction of all-trans-retinal to  all-trans-retinol within the photoreceptor outer segment.},

We systematically examined the sites of phosphorylation upon flash activation of Rho in rod outer segment (ROS) homogenates. Addition of an inhibitory antibody against rhodopsin kinase (RK) lowered phosphorylation at Ser, Ser, and Ser, without changing the ratio between phosphorylation sites. In contrast, no effect of protein kinase C was detected after stimulation (by a phorbol ester), inhibition (with H7), or reconstitution of protein kinase C with purified ROS membranes. The stoichiometry and the ratio between different phosphorylation sites in purified Rho were also reproduced using RK, purified to apparent homogeneity from ROS or from an insect cell expression system. Thus, we conclude that light-dependent phosphorylation of Rho is mediated primarily by RK. Depalmitoylation of Rho at Cys and Cys altered the conformation of the C terminus of Rho, as observed by phosphorylation by casein kinase I, but did not affect phosphorylation by RK. The sites of phosphorylation were influenced, however, by the presence of four conserved amino acids at the C terminus of Rho. The accumulation of phosphorylated Ser observed in vivo could result from slower dephosphorylation of this site as compared with dephosphorylation of Ser and Ser. These data provide a molecular mechanism for the site-specific phosphorylation of Rho observed in vivo.},

These proteins are a complex of three subunits  designated alpha, beta and gamma. The alpha-subunit is responsible for binding  guanine nucleotides and seems to be characteristic of each protein. Transducin, a  member of this protein family, mediates visual transduction by coupling the signal  of photolysed rhodopsin with activation of a cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase. We have  now cloned and sequenced the complementary DNA encoding the alpha-subunit of bovine  retinal transducin and from this we have deduced the complete amino-acid sequence.  The transducin alpha-subunit shares several homologous amino-acid sequences with ras  gene products. The homologous segments correspond mostly to the regions thought to  be involved in the guanine nucleotide binding and GTPase activity of ras proteins  and to the ADP-ribosylation sites of the transducin alpha-subunit.},

We found that rod outer segment membranes contain tightly bound radioactive  GDP after incubation in the dark with [3H]GDP or [alpha-32P]GTP. Reconstituted  membranes containing only rhodopsin and phospholipid bind almost no GDP. More than  80\% of the radioactive GDP bound to rod outer segment membranes could be released by  subsequent illumination. At low light levels, the rate and extent of GDP release  were markedly enhanced by the presence of GTP or p[NH]ppG, a nonhydrolyzable analog  of GTP. The kinetics of binding of p[NH]ppG paralleled the kinetics of release of  bound GDP, indicating that p[NH]ppG was exchanged for bound GDP. The maximal amount  of bound p[NH]ppG was 1 per 30 rhodopsins when photolyzed membranes were incubated  with 10 micro M nucleotide. Under these conditions, p[NH]ppG binding was  half-maximal when only 1 in 90,000 rhodopsins was photolyzed. This corresponds to  the catalyzed exchange of 500 p[NH]ppG for bound GDP per photolyzed rhodopsin. We  propose a light-activated GTP-GDP amplification cycle involving a guanyl nucleotide  binding protein with GTPase activity (E). The essence of this cycle is that  photolyzed rhodopsin catalyzes the formation of E . GTP from E . GDP (the major  species in the dark) by nucleotide exchange. The formation of several hundred E .  GTP per photolyzed rhodopsin may be the first stage of amplification in visual  excitation.},

Subsequent deactivation of this  light-activated enzyme cascade involves hydrolysis of the GTP bound to transducin,  as well as decay of the activating capacity of R*. We report here that deactivation  of PDEase in rod outer segment suspensions is highly enhanced by addition of ATP and  purified 48-kDa protein, which is an intrinsic rod outer segment protein that is  soluble in the dark but binds to photolyzed rhodopsin that has been phosphorylated  by rhodopsin kinase and ATP [Kühn, H., Hall, S.W. \& Wilden, U. (1984) FEBS Lett.  176, 473-478]. To analyze the mechanism by which ATP and 48-kDa protein deactivate  PDEase, we used an ATP-free system consisting of thoroughly washed disk membranes,  whose rhodopsin had been previously phosphorylated and chromophore-regenerated, and  to which purified PDEase and transducin were reassociated. Such phosphorylated  membranes exhibited a significantly lower (by a factor less than or equal to 5)  light-induced PDEase-activating capacity than unphosphorylated controls. Addition of  purified 48-kDa protein to phosphorylated membranes further suppressed their  PDEase-activating capacity; suppression could be as high as 98\% (as compared to  unphosphorylated membranes), depending on the amount of 48-kDa protein and the flash  intensity. Addition of ATP had little further effect. In contrast, PDEase activation  or deactivation with unphosphorylated control membranes was not influenced by 48-kDa  protein, even in the presence of ATP, provided rhodopsin kinase was absent. Our data  suggest that 48-kDa protein binds to phosphorylated R* and thereby quenches its  capacity to activate transducin and PDEase.},

By measuring light-scattering changes above 700 nm, we have studied the kinetics and  stoichiometry of the association of R* with this protein and of the dissociation of  the complex upon GDP/GTP exchange. Two light-scattering signals were obtained upon  photoexcitation of rhodopsin in bovine rod outer segment membranes as well as in a  reconstituted system consisting of purified GTP-binding protein and washed disc  membranes; both signals depended specifically on the presence of GTP-binding  protein. A "binding signal" that was observed in the absence of gTP as an increase  in turbidity became saturated when a number of rhodopsin molecules equal to the  number of GTP-binding protein molecules present (congruent to 10\% in rod outer  segments) has been bleached, suggesting that the protein binds to R* in a 1:1  complex. A "dissociation signal" of opposite sign, observed in presence of GTP at  greater than or equal to 1 microM, is half maximal at 0.04\% bleaching and saturated  at 0.5\% bleaching; it is interpreted as reflecting the dissociation of GTP-binding  protein-R* complexes after GDP/GTP exchange on the GTP-binding protein, one R* being  able to interact sequentially with about 100 GTP-binding protein molecules. The  early time course of the binding signal is faster than that of the dissociation  signal, and both signals take place in the 100-msec range at 20 degrees C.},

The ability of various  enzymatically truncated forms of photolyzed rhodopsin (Rho*) to stimulate rhodopsin  kinase activity was quantified. Following endopeptidase Asp-N cleavage of all  phosphorylation sites on the C-terminal, the resulting truncated Rho* (329G-Rho*)  was not phosphorylated by rhodopsin kinase. This suggests that rhodopsin kinase only  phosphorylates C-terminal sites of Rho*. However 329G-Rho* could bind rhodopsin  kinase and stimulate phosphorylation of exogenous peptide. Kinase stimulation was  investigated for other truncated forms of Rho* in which the C-terminal region was  either partially or completely eliminated, and the V-VI loop was either cleaved or  left intact (339K-Rho*, 341E239E-Rho*, 329G239E-Rho*, 327P240S-Rho*). Results  suggest that the V-VI loop is crucial for kinase binding (similar to the binding of  GT). Mastoparan, a model peptide for G-protein-coupled receptors, was found to  stimulate rhodopsin kinase in a mechanism similar to that of truncated Rho*.

This protein differs from the known low and high density plasma  lipoproteins and has a hydrated density greater than 1.21. In order to study this  protein, volunteers were injected intravenously with retinol-15-(14)C. Plasma was  collected 1-3 days later, and the purification of retinol-binding protein (RBP) was  monitored by assaying for (14)C and also by following the fluorescence of the  protein-bound retinol. Purification of RBP was effected by the sequence: Cohn  fractionation, chromatography on columns of Sephadex G-200 and diethylaminoethyl  (DEAE)-Sephadex, preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and finally  chromatography on Sephadex G-100. These procedures resulted in a preparation of RBP  which was at least 98\% pure and which had been purified more than 1500-fold.  Purified RBP has alpha(1) mobility on electrophoresis and has a molecular weight of  approximately 21,000-22,000. There appears to be one binding site for retinol per  molecule of RBP. Solutions of RBP are fluorescent (characteristic of retinol) and  have ultraviolet absorption spectra with peaks at 330 mmu (resulting from the bound  retinol) and at 280 mmu. There are no fatty acid or fatty acyl chains present in  purified RBP. The usual concentration of RBP in plasma is of the order of 3-4 mg/100  ml. In plasma, RBP apparently circulates as a complex, together with another, larger  protein with prealbumin mobility on electrophoresis. The RBP-prealbumin complex  remains intact during Cohn fractionation and during chromatography on Sephadex and  on DEAE-Sephadex columns. The complex dissociates during gel electrophoresis,  permitting the isolation and subsequent purification of each of the components. The  complex is again formed by mixing together solutions of the separated RBP and of  prealbumin. Retinol transport in plasma thus appears to involve both a lipid-protein  (retinol-RBP) interaction and a protein-protein (RBP-prealbumin) interaction.},

Absorption of light that exceeds a plant's capacity for  fixation of CO2 results in thermal dissipation of excitation energy in the pigment  antenna of photosystem II by a poorly understood mechanism. This regulatory process,  termed nonphotochemical quenching, maintains the balance between dissipation and  utilization of light energy to minimize generation of oxidizing molecules, thereby  protecting the plant against photo-oxidative damage. To identify specific proteins  that are involved in nonphotochemical quenching, we have isolated mutants of  Arabidopsis thaliana that cannot dissipate excess absorbed light energy. Here we  show that the gene encoding PsbS, an intrinsic chlorophyll-binding protein of  photosystem II, is necessary for nonphotochemical quenching but not for efficient  light harvesting and photosynthesis. These results indicate that PsbS may be the  site for nonphotochemical quenching, a finding that has implications for the  functional evolution of pigment-binding proteins.},

In the retinal pigmented epithelium, LRAT plays a key role  in the retinoid cycle, a two-cell recycling system that replenishes the  11-cis-retinal chromophore of rhodopsin and cone pigments. We disrupted mouse Lrat  gene expression by targeted recombination and generated a homozygous Lrat knock-out  (Lrat-/-) mouse. Despite the expression of LRAT in multiple tissues, the Lrat-/-  mouse develops normally. The histological analysis and electron microscopy of the  retina for 6-8-week-old Lrat-/- mice revealed that the rod outer segments are  approximately 35\% shorter than those of Lrat+/+ mice, whereas other neuronal layers  appear normal. Lrat-/- mice have trace levels of all-trans-retinyl esters in the  liver, lung, eye, and blood, whereas the circulating all-trans-retinol is reduced  only slightly. Scotopic and photopic electroretinograms as well as pupillary  constriction analyses revealed that rod and cone visual functions are severely  attenuated at an early age. We conclude that Lrat-/- mice may serve as an animal  model with early onset severe retinal dystrophy and severe retinyl ester  deprivation.},

Bovine CRALBP contains 316  residues in a single amino-terminal-blocked chain corresponding to a molecular  weight of 36,421, inclusive of the blocking group. Overlapping peptides were  generated by cleavage of lysyl, arginyl, methionyl, glutamyl, and one tryptophanyl  bond and sequenced by gas-phase Edman degradation. Analysis of amino-terminal  arginyl and methionyl peptides by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry identified  the N alpha-blocking group as an acetyl moiety, and tandem mass spectrometry  provided the sequence of the first 9 residues. Comparison of CRALBP with other known  protein sequences reveals no significant structural relatedness.

In the current study, molecular genetic analysis of  a consanguineous pedigree segregating for non-syndromic autosomal recessive  retinitis pigmentosa (arRP) indicated that the affected siblings were homozygous by  descent for a G4763A nucleotide substitution in RLBP1, the gene encoding cellular  retinaldehyde-binding protein (CRALBP). This substitution is predicted to replace an  arginine with glutamine at residue 150. CRALBP is not expressed in photoreceptors  but is abundant in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and Müller cells of the  neuroretina, where it carries 11-cis-retinol and 11-cis-retinaldehyde. When  expressed in bacteria, recombinant CRALBP (rCRALBP) containing the R150Q  substitution was less soluble than wild-type rCRALBP. Mutant rCRALBP was purified  from the soluble cell lysate and the protein structure was verified by mass  spectrometry. The mutant protein lacked the ability to bind 11-cis-retinaldehyde.  These findings suggest that arRP in the current pedigree results from a lack of  functional CRALBP, presumably leading to disruption of retinal vitamin-A metabolism.},

Studies in chick using treatment with RA or RA receptor antagonists suggested a two-signal model for limb proximodistal patterning in which a proximal RA signal opposes a distal fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signal.Genetic loss-of-function studies in mice confirmed a requirement for distal FGF but not proximal RA in limb proximodistal patterning, thus supporting a one-signal model in which distal FGFs alone control patterning. RA was found to promote forelimb initiation by repressing Fgf8 along the body axis before limb budding.RA–FGF8 antagonism has also been found to be essential for somitogenesis and neurogenesis during body axis extension. RA directly represses caudal Fgf8 through an upstream retinoic acid response element.Genetic loss of RA synthesis has identified several additional roles for RA signalling during organogenesis, including neuronal differentiation in the hindbrain and spinal cord, eye morphogenesis, differentiation of forebrain basal ganglia, heart development and spermatogenesis. The putative role of RA in these developmental processes has been backed up by the identification of target genes that both require RA for normal expression and have nearby functional retinoic acid response elements.Understanding the mechanism of RA-mediated activation and repression during development will benefit efforts to obtain differentiated cell types that are useful in regenerative medicine.},

Severe  vitamin A deprivation in rodents results in maternal infertility, precluding a  thorough investigation of the role of RA during embryogenesis. Here we show that  production of RA by the retinaldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (Raldh2) enzyme is required  for mouse embryo survival and early morphogenesis. Raldh2 is an NAD-dependent  aldehyde dehydrogenase with high substrate specificity for retinaldehyde. Its  pattern of expression during mouse development has suggested that it may be  responsible for embryonic RA synthesis. We generated a targeted disruption of the  mouse Raldh2 gene and found that Raldh2-/- embryos, which die at midgestation  without undergoing axial rotation (body turning), exhibit shortening along the  anterioposterior axis and do not form limb buds. Their heart consists of a single,  medial, dilated cavity. Their frontonasal region is truncated and their otocysts are  severely reduced. These defects result from a block in embryonic RA synthesis, as  shown by the lack of activity of RA-responsive transgenes, the altered expression of  an RA-target homeobox gene and the near full rescue of the mutant phenotype by  maternal RA administration. Our data establish that RA synthesized by the  post-implantation mammalian embryo is an essential developmental hormone whose lack  leads to early embryo death.},

There is indirect evidence that the signal from the polarizing region is a diffusible morphogen3.

All-trans retinoic acid (RA) and other active retinoids are generated from  vitamin A (retinol), but key aspects of the signaling pathways required to produce  active retinoids remain unclear. Retinoids generated by one cell type can affect  nearby cells, so retinoids also function in intercellular communication. RA induces  differentiation primarily by binding to RARs, transcription factors that associate  with RXRs and bind RAREs in the nucleus. Binding of RA: (1) initiates changes in  interactions of RAR/RXRs with co-repressor and co-activator proteins, activating  transcription of primary target genes; (2) alters interactions with proteins that  induce epigenetic changes; (3) induces transcription of genes encoding transcription  factors and signaling proteins that further modify gene expression (e.g., FOX03A,  Hoxa1, Sox9, TRAIL, UBE2D3); and (4) results in alterations in estrogen receptor α  signaling. Proteins that bind at or near RAREs include Sin3a, N-CoR1, PRAME, Trim24,  NRIP1, Ajuba, Zfp423, and MN1/TEL. Interactions among retinoids, RARs/RXRs, and  these proteins explain in part the powerful effects of retinoids on stem cell  differentiation. Studies of this retinol signaling cascade enhance our ability to  understand and regulate stem cell differentiation for therapeutic and scientific  purposes. In cancer chemotherapeutic regimens retinoids can promote tumor cell  differentiation and/or induce proteins that sensitize tumors to drug combinations.  Mechanistic studies of retinoid signaling continue to suggest novel drug targets and  will improve therapeutic strategies for cancer and other diseases, such as  immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.},

The first enzymatic step in RA synthesis, the oxidation of retinol to  retinal, is thought to be carried out by the ubiquitous or overlapping activities of  redundant alcohol dehydrogenases. The second oxidation step, the conversion of  retinal to RA, is performed by retinaldehyde dehydrogenases. Thus, the specific  spatiotemporal distribution of retinoid synthesis is believed to be controlled  exclusively at the level of the second oxidation reaction. In an  N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-induced forward genetic screen we discovered a new  midgestation lethal mouse mutant, called trex, which displays craniofacial, limb,  and organ abnormalities. The trex phenotype is caused by a mutation in the  short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase, RDH10. Using protein modeling, enzymatic  assays, and mutant embryos, we determined that RDH10(trex) mutant protein lacks the  ability to oxidize retinol to retinal, resulting in insufficient RA signaling. Thus,  we show that the first oxidative step of Vitamin A metabolism, which is catalyzed in  large part by the retinol dehydrogenase RDH10, is critical for the spatiotemporal  synthesis of RA. Furthermore, these results identify a new nodal point in RA  metabolism during embryogenesis.},

	abstract = {Retinoic acid acts as a signalling molecule regulating many developmental events in  vertebrates. As this molecule directly influences gene expression by activating  nuclear receptors, its patterns of synthesis have to be tightly regulated, and it is  well established that at least three retinaldehyde dehydrogenases (RALDHs) are  involved in such tissue-specific synthesis. Whereas embryos from oviparous species  can obtain retinaldehyde by metabolizing carotenoids stored in the yolk, placental  embryos rely on retinol transferred from the maternal circulation. Here, we show  that the gene encoding one of the murine retinol dehydrogenases, Rdh10, is expressed  according to complex profiles both during early embryogenesis and organ  differentiation. Many of its expression sites correlate with regions of active  retinoid signalling and Raldh gene expression, especially with Raldh2 in the early  presomitic and somitic mesoderm, retrocardiac and posterior branchial arch region,  or later in the pleural mesothelium and kidney cortical region. Rdh10 also shows  cell-type and/or regional specificity during development of the palate, teeth, and  olfactory system. During limb bud development, it may participate in retinoic acid  production in proximal/posterior cells, and eventually in interdigital mesenchyme.  These data implicate the retinol to retinaldehyde conversion as the first step in  the tissue-specific regulation of retinoic acid synthesis, at least in mammalian  embryos.},

This review focuses on the essential role of  vitamin A in female reproduction and embryonic development and the metabolism of  vitamin A (retinol) that results in these functions. Evidence strongly supports that  in situ-generated all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) is the functional form of vitamin A  in female reproduction and embryonic development. This is supported by the ability  to reverse most reproductive and developmental blocks found in vitamin A deficiency  with atRA, the block in embryonic development that occurs in retinaldehyde  dehydrogenase type 2 null mutant mice, and the essential roles of the retinoic acid  receptors, at least in embryogenesis. Early studies of embryos from marginally  vitamin A-deficient (VAD) pregnant rats revealed a collection of defects called the  vitamin A-deficiency syndrome. The manipulation of all-trans retinoic acid (atRA)  levels in the diet of VAD female rats undergoing a reproduction cycle has proved to  be an important new tool in deciphering the points of atRA function in early embryos  and has provided a means to generate large numbers of embryos at later stages of  development with the vitamin A-deficiency syndrome. The essentiality of the retinoid  receptors in mediating the activity of atRA is exemplified by the many compound null  mutant embryos that now recapitulate both the original vitamin A-deficiency syndrome  and exhibit a host of new defects, many of which can also be observed in the  VAD-atRA-supported rat embryo model and in retinaldehyde dehydrogenase type 2  (RALDH2) mutant mice. A major task for the future is to elucidate the atRA-dependent  pathways that are normally operational in vitamin A-sufficient animals and that are  perturbed in deficiency, thus leading to the characteristic VAD phenotypes described  above.},

Usually these plants secrete an endogenous milk-like fluid in a network of laticifer cells in which sub-cellular organelles intensively synthesize proteins and secondary metabolites. The biological importance of latexes is still unclear and accumulated evidences of their physiological role are still limited. Here laticifer proteins (LP) from Calotropis procera were assayed for insecticidal action against different crop pests in attempt to give new insights for the biological role of latexes. Diets containing 4\% LP affected survival (LD50=4.61\%) and decreased weight gain (ED50=3.07\%) of third instars Ceratitis capitata (Diptera: Tephritidae). Third instars Anticarsia gemmatalis (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) fed on diets containing 0.1\% (w/w) of LP showed reduced body mass while survival was reduced (LD50=0.48\%) only for insects grown on 0.5\% LP-containing diets. Nonetheless, 1\% LP was ineffective against third instars Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Diets containing 1\% LP slightly diminished survival of Dysdercus peruvianus (Hemiptera: Pyrrhocoridae) nymphs while 2\% LP was more effective with consistent reduction in bodyweight (ED50=1.4\%) observed at the 14th day. Digestive enzymes of gut extracts of D. peruvianus were unable to breakdown LP. On the contrary, heat treated LP was capable of reducing by 50\% proteolysis of gut extracts using BANA as substrate suggesting presence of inhibitory activity of cysteine proteinases. Adults of D. peruvianus were not affected when grown in diets containing 1\% of LP. Laticifer proteins were shown to possess chitin-binding proteins and chitinolytic activity. Lectin activity was not detected. Occurrence of cysteine proteinase activity already reported in C. procera latex combined with the activities described here could explain, at least in part, the deleterious effects observed.},

	abstract = {Sterols are important not only for structural components of eukaryotic cell membranes but also for biosynthetic precursors of steroid hormones. In plants, the diverse functions of sterol-derived brassinosteroids (BRs) in growth and development have been investigated rigorously, yet little is known about the regulatory roles of other phytosterols. Recent analysis of Arabidopsis fackel(fk) mutants and cloning of the FK gene that encodes a sterol C-14 reductase have indicated that sterols play a crucial role in plant cell division, embryogenesis, and development. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism underlying the regulatory role of sterols in plant development has not been revealed. In this report, we demonstrate that both sterols and BR are active regulators of plant development and gene expression. Similar to BR, both typical (sitosterol and stigmasterol) and atypical (8, 14-diene sterols accumulated in fk mutants) sterols affect the expression of genes involved in cell expansion and cell division. The regulatory function of sterols in plant development is further supported by a phenocopy of the fk mutant using a sterol C-14 reductase inhibitor, fenpropimorph. Although fenpropimorph impairs cell expansion and affects gene expression in a dose-dependent manner, neither effect can be corrected by applying exogenous BR. These results provide strong evidence that sterols are essential for normal plant growth and development and that there is likely a BR-independent sterol response pathway in plants. On the basis of the expression of endogenousFK and a reporter geneFK::β-glucuronidase, we have found that FK is up-regulated by several growth-promoting hormones including brassinolide and auxin, implicating a possible hormone crosstalk between sterol and other hormone-signaling pathways.},

SMRT is a previously undiscovered protein  whose association with receptors both in solution and bound to DNA-response elements  is destabilized by ligand. The interaction with mutant receptors correlates with  their transcriptional silencing activities.

In contrast, on elements consisting of direct  repeats spaced by one base pair (DR + 1 elements), RAR/RXR heterodimers exhibit  little or no response to activating ligands and repress RXR-dependent transcription.  Here we show that ligand-dependent transactivation by RAR on DR + 5 elements  requires the dissociation of a new nuclear receptor co-repressor, N-CoR, and  recruitment of the putative co-activators p140 and p160. Surprisingly, on DR + 1  elements, N-CoR remains associated with RAR/RXR heterodimers even in the presence of  RAR ligands, resulting in constitutive repression.

	abstract = {Sterols, which are isoprenoid derivatives, are structural components of biological  membranes. Special attention is now being given not only to their structure and  function, but also to their regulatory roles in plants. Plant sterols have diverse  composition; they exist as free sterols, sterol esters with higher fatty acids,  sterol glycosides, and acylsterol glycosides, which are absent in animal cells. This  diversity of types of phytosterols determines a wide spectrum of functions they play  in plant life. Sterols are precursors of a group of plant hormones, the  brassinosteroids, which regulate plant growth and development. Furthermore, sterols  participate in transmembrane signal transduction by forming lipid microdomains. The  predominant sterols in plants are β-sitosterol, campesterol, and stigmasterol. These  sterols differ in the presence of a methyl or an ethyl group in the side chain at  the 24th carbon atom and are named methylsterols or ethylsterols, respectively. The  balance between 24-methylsterols and 24-ethylsterols is specific for individual  plant species. The present review focuses on the key stages of plant sterol  biosynthesis that determine the ratios between the different types of sterols, and  the crosstalk between the sterol and sphingolipid pathways. The main enzymes  involved in plant sterol biosynthesis are 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase,  C24-sterol methyltransferase, and C22-sterol desaturase. These enzymes are  responsible for maintaining the optimal balance between sterols. Regulation of the  ratios between the different types of sterols and sterols/sphingolipids can be of  crucial importance in the responses of plants to stresses.},

In this report, we describe the identification,  molecular cloning, and characterization of a second related enzyme, P450RAI-2, which  is also involved in the specific inactivation of all-trans-RA. Transiently  transfected P450RAI-2 can convert all-trans-RA to more polar metabolites including  4-oxo-, 4-OH-, and 18-OH-all-trans-RA. Competition experiments with other retinoids  suggest that all-trans-RA is the preferred substrate. The high level of expression  of P450RAI-2, particularly in the cerebellum and pons of human adult brain, suggests  a unique role for this enzyme in the protection of specific tissues from exposure to  retinoids.},

	abstract = {The Cytochrome P450 (CYP) family 26 enzymes contribute to retinoic acid (RA)  metabolism and homeostasis in humans, mammals and other chordates. The three CYP26  family enzymes, CYP26A1, CYP26B1 and CYP26C1 have all been shown to metabolize  all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA) it's 9-cisRA and 13-cisRA isomers and primary  metabolites 4-OH-RA and 4-oxo-RA with high efficiency. While no crystal structures  of CYP26 enzymes are available, the binding of various ligands has been extensively  explored via homology modeling. All three CYP26 enzymes are inducible by treatment  with atRA in various prenatal and postnatal tissues and cell types. However, current  literature shows that in addition to regulation by atRA, CYP26 enzyme expression is  also regulated by other endogenous processes and inflammatory cytokines. In humans  and in animal models the expression patterns of CYP26 enzymes have been shown to be  tissue and cell type specific, and the expression of the CYP26 enzymes is believed  to regulate the formation of critical atRA concentration gradients in various tissue  types. Yet, very little data exists on direct disease associations of altered CYP26  expression or activity. Nevertheless, data is emerging describing a variety of human  genetic variations in the CYP26 enzymes that are associated with different  pathologies. Interestingly, some of these genetic variants result in increased  activity of the CYP26 enzymes potentially leading to complex gene-environment  interactions due to variability in dietary intake of retinoids. This review  highlights the current knowledge of structure-function of CYP26 enzymes and focuses  on their role in human retinoid metabolism in different tissues.},

However, its continued use is challenged by its  poor tolerability, poor compliance with complex dosing regimens, and the  availability of more efficacious anti-malarial drugs. This article reviews the  historical role of quinine, considers its current usage and provides insight into  its appropriate future use in the treatment of malaria. In light of recent research  findings intravenous artesunate should be the first-line drug for severe malaria,  with quinine as an alternative. The role of rectal quinine as pre-referral treatment  for severe malaria has not been fully explored, but it remains a promising  intervention. In pregnancy, quinine continues to play a critical role in the  management of malaria, especially in the first trimester, and it will remain a  mainstay of treatment until safer alternatives become available. For uncomplicated  malaria, artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) offers a better option than  quinine though the difficulty of maintaining a steady supply of ACT in  resource-limited settings renders the rapid withdrawal of quinine for uncomplicated  malaria cases risky. The best approach would be to identify solutions to ACT  stock-outs, maintain quinine in case of ACT stock-outs, and evaluate strategies for  improving quinine treatment outcomes by combining it with antibiotics. In HIV and TB  infected populations, concerns about potential interactions between quinine and  antiretroviral and anti-tuberculosis drugs exist, and these will need further  research and pharmacovigilance.},

Genetic analysis  in Escherichia coli identified only two genes of unknown function required for  pimelate synthesis, bioC and bioH.

At the origin of metabolism, CO2 fixation by hydrothermal H2 within serpentinizing systems could have preceded and patterned biotic pathways. Here we show that three hydrothermal minerals-greigite (Fe3S4), magnetite (Fe3O4) and awaruite (Ni3Fe)-catalyse the fixation of CO2 with H2 at 100 °C under alkaline aqueous conditions. The product spectrum includes formate (up to 200 mM), acetate (up to 100 µM), pyruvate (up to 10 µM), methanol (up to 100 µM) and methane. The results shed light on both the geochemical origin of microbial metabolism and the nature of abiotic formate and methane synthesis in modern hydrothermal vents.},

	abstract = {For decades, microbiologists have viewed the acetyl CoA pathway and organisms that use it for H2-dependent carbon and energy metabolism, acetogens and methanogens, as ancient. Classical evidence and newer evidence indicating the antiquity of the acetyl CoA pathway are summarized here. The acetyl CoA pathway requires approximately 10 enzymes, roughly as many organic cofactors, and more than 500 kDa of combined subunit molecular mass to catalyze the conversion of H2 and CO2 to formate, acetate, and pyruvate in acetogens and methanogens. However, a single hydrothermal vent alloy, awaruite (Ni3Fe), can convert H2 and CO2 to formate, acetate, and pyruvate under mild hydrothermal conditions on its own. The chemical reactions of H2 and CO2 to pyruvate thus have a natural tendency to occur without enzymes, given suitable inorganic catalysts. This suggests that the evolution of the enzymatic acetyl CoA pathway was preceded by-and patterned along-a route of naturally occurring exergonic reactions catalyzed by transition metal minerals that could activate H2 and CO2 by chemisorption. The principle of forward (autotrophic) pathway evolution from preexisting non-enzymatic reactions is generalized to the concept of patterned evolution of pathways. In acetogens, exergonic reduction of CO2 by H2 generates acyl phosphates by highly reactive carbonyl groups undergoing attack by inert inorganic phosphate. In that ancient reaction of biochemical energy conservation, the energy behind formation of the acyl phosphate bond resides in the carbonyl, not in phosphate. The antiquity of the acetyl CoA pathway is usually seen in light of CO2 fixation; its role in primordial energy coupling via acyl phosphates and substrate-level phosphorylation is emphasized here.},

	abstract = {p{\textgreater} Life’s catabolic processes capture chemical energy from the oxidative breakdown of metabolites. In the catabolic pathways at the core of biochemistry, the oxidation of α- ketoacids or aldehydes is coupled to the synthesis of thioesters, whose energy-releasing hydrolysis is in turn coupled to the production of adenosine 5’-triphosphate (ATP). How these processes became linked before life emerged, and thus how the framework for modern bioenergetics was established, is a major problem for understanding the origins of biochemistry. The structure of biochemical networks suggests that the intermediary role of thioesters in biological energy flows, and their central role in biosynthesis, is a consequence of their entry into metabolism at the earliest stage of biochemical evolution. However, how thioesters could have become embedded within a metabolic network before the advent of enzymes remains unclear. Here we demonstrate non-enzymatic oxidant- or light-driven thioester synthesis from biological α- ketoacids and show it can be integrated within an iron-promoted metabolism-like reaction network. The thioesters obtained are those predicted to be pivotal in computational reconstructions of primitive biochemical networks (acetyl, malonyl, malyl and succinyl thioesters), demonstrating a rare convergence between top-down and bottom-up approaches to the origins of metabolism. The diversity and simplicity of conditions that form thioesters from core metabolites suggests the energetic link between thioester synthesis and catabolism was in place at the earliest stage of prebiotic chemistry, constraining the path for the later evolution of life’s phosphorus-based energy currencies.},

Among the six known CO2 fixation pathways in nature, the acetyl-CoA (AcCoA; or Wood–Ljungdahl) pathway is the most ancient, and relies on transition metals for catalysis. Modern microbes that use the AcCoA pathway typically fix CO2 with electrons from H2, which requires complex flavin-based electron bifurcation. This presents a paradox: how could primitive metabolic systems have fixed CO2 before the origin of proteins? Here, we show that native transition metals (Fe0, Ni0 and Co0) selectively reduce CO2 to acetate and pyruvate—the intermediates and end-products of the AcCoA pathway—in near millimolar concentrations in water over hours to days using 1–40 bar CO2 and at temperatures from 30 to 100 °C. Geochemical CO2 fixation from native metals could have supplied critical C2 and C3 metabolites before the emergence of enzymes.},

Serpentinization converts iron(II) containing minerals and water to magnetite (Fe3O4) plus H2. The hydrogen can generate native metals such as awaruite (Ni3Fe), a common serpentinization product. Awaruite catalyzes the synthesis of methane from H2 and CO2 under hydrothermal conditions. Native iron and nickel catalyze the synthesis of formate, methanol, acetate, and pyruvate\&mdash;intermediates of the acetyl-CoA pathway, the most ancient pathway of CO2 fixation. Carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH) is central to the pathway and employs Ni0 in its catalytic mechanism. CODH has been conserved during 4 billion years of evolution as a relic of the natural CO2-reducing catalyst at the onset of biochemistry. The carbide-containing active site of nitrogenase\&mdash;the only enzyme on Earth that reduces N2\&mdash;is probably also a relic, a biological reconstruction of the naturally occurring inorganic catalyst that generated primordial organic nitrogen. Serpentinization generates Fe3O4 and H2, the catalyst and reductant for industrial CO2 hydrogenation and for N2 reduction via the Haber\&ndash;Bosch process. In both industrial processes, an Fe3O4 catalyst is matured via H2-dependent reduction to generate Fe5C2 and Fe2N respectively. Whether serpentinization entails similar catalyst maturation is not known. We suggest that at the onset of life, essential reactions leading to reduced carbon and reduced nitrogen occurred with catalysts that were synthesized during the serpentinization process, connecting the chemistry of life and Earth to industrial chemistry in unexpected ways.},

Thermodynamic constraints make chemiosmosis strictly necessary for carbon and energy metabolism in all free-living chemotrophs, and presumably the first free-living cells too. Proton gradients form naturally at alkaline hydrothermal vents and are viewed as central to the origin of life. Here we consider how the earliest cells might have harnessed a geochemically created proton-motive force and then learned to make their own, a transition that was necessary for their escape from the vents. Synthesis of ATP by chemiosmosis today involves generation of an ion gradient by means of vectorial electron transfer from a donor to an acceptor. We argue that the first donor was hydrogen and the first acceptor CO2.},

However, the fact that five alternative autotrophic pathways exist in prokaryotes is often neglected. This bias may lead to serious misjudgments in models of the global carbon cycle, in hypotheses on the evolution of metabolism, and in interpretations of geological records. Here, I review these alternative pathways that differ fundamentally from the Calvin-Benson cycle. Revealingly, these five alternative pathways pivot on acetyl-coenzyme A, the turntable of metabolism, demanding a gluconeogenic pathway starting from acetyl-coenzyme A and CO(2). It appears that the formation of an activated acetic acid from inorganic carbon represents the initial step toward metabolism. Consequently, biosyntheses likely started from activated acetic acid and gluconeogenesis preceded glycolysis.},

The crown clades of the two primary divisions of life, Eubacteria and Archaebacteria, emerged much later ({\textless}3.4 Ga), relegating the oldest fossil evidence for life to their stem lineages.

	abstract = {How and where did life on Earth originate? To date, various environments have been proposed as plausible sites for the origin of life. However, discussions have focused on a limited stage of chemical evolution, or emergence of a specific chemical function of proto-biological systems. It remains unclear what geochemical situations could drive all the stages of chemical evolution, ranging from condensation of simple inorganic compounds to the emergence of self-sustaining systems that were evolvable into modern biological ones. In this review, we summarize reported experimental and theoretical findings for prebiotic chemistry relevant to this topic, including availability of biologically essential elements (N and P) on the Hadean Earth, abiotic synthesis of life's building blocks (amino acids, peptides, ribose, nucleobases, fatty acids, nucleotides, and oligonucleotides), their polymerizations to bio-macromolecules (peptides and oligonucleotides), and emergence of biological functions of replication and compartmentalization. It is indicated from the overviews that completion of the chemical evolution requires at least eight reaction conditions of (1) reductive gas phase, (2) alkaline pH, (3) freezing temperature, (4) fresh water, (5) dry/dry-wet cycle, (6) coupling with high energy reactions, (7) heating-cooling cycle in water, and (8) extraterrestrial input of life's building blocks and reactive nutrients. The necessity of these mutually exclusive conditions clearly indicates that life's origin did not occur at a single setting; rather, it required highly diverse and dynamic environments that were connected with each other to allow intra-transportation of reaction products and reactants through fluid circulation. Future experimental research that mimics the conditions of the proposed model are expected to provide further constraints on the processes and mechanisms for the origin of life.},

The reaction itself is a vital step in the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids, lending the enzyme a biological importance equal to its importance in understanding mechanisms of catalysis. In this issue of PNAS, Hur and Bruice (1) have applied the near-attack conformation (NAC) concept, which Bruice and coworkers have been developing for several years (2, 3), to the accelerations produced by several different chorismate mutases, developing thereby what might be called a microhistory of the catalytic process for these enzymes, tracing events between reactant state and transition state. The findings are illuminating and likely to generate considerable surprise.

Chorismate rearranges to prephenate: the reaction catalyzed by chorismate mutases. Very roughly and schematically, the structures represent reactive conformers.



Explaining enzyme catalysis has always posed an adequate challenge. Enzymes are powerful catalysts, some accelerating their target reactions by factors that can exceed 1020 (4). Chorismate mutases accelerate their target reaction by ≈106- to 107-fold. The details of how such accelerations are orchestrated in the course of a process in which the enzyme encounters reactant molecules, may, in some cases, shepherd them through various intermediate states to the product molecule(s), and then releases the latter before launching a new catalytic cycle, have been a subject of research, speculation, and debate since the discovery of enzymes.

One of the main conceptual tools for organizing the findings has been Pauling's insight (5) that an enzyme is a biomolecule that specifically binds and thus stabilizes the transition state of the target …},

Synthetic production of model protocells can demonstrate the potential processes by which living cells first arose. While we have previously described a giant vesicle (GV)-based model protocell in which amplification of DNA was linked to self-reproduction, the ability of a protocell to recursively self-proliferate for multiple generations has not been demonstrated. Here we show that newborn daughter GVs can be restored to the status of their parental GVs by pH-induced vesicular fusion of daughter GVs with conveyer GVs filled with depleted substrates. We describe a primitive model cell cycle comprising four discrete phases (ingestion, replication, maturity and division), each of which is selectively activated by a specific external stimulus. The production of recursive self-proliferating model protocells represents a step towards eventual production of model protocells that are able to mimic evolution.},

	abstract = {A symmetric origin for bacterial ferredoxins was first proposed over 50 y ago, yet, to date, no functional symmetric molecule has been constructed. It is hypothesized that extant proteins have drifted from their symmetric roots via gene duplication followed by mutations. Phylogenetic analyses of extant ferredoxins support the independent evolution of N- and C-terminal sequences, thereby allowing consensus-based design of symmetric 4Fe-4S molecules. All designs bind two [4Fe-4S] clusters and exhibit strongly reducing midpoint potentials ranging from −405 to −515 mV. One of these constructs efficiently shuttles electrons through a designed metabolic pathway in Escherichia coli. These finding establish that ferredoxins consisting of a symmetric core can be used as a platform to design novel electron transfer carriers for in vivo applications. Outer-shell asymmetry increases sequence space without compromising electron transfer functionality.},

Small unilamellar fatty acid vesicles grow when fed with fatty acid micelles and can be forced to divide by extrusion, but this artificial division process results in significant loss of protocell contents during each division cycle. Here we describe a simple and efficient pathway for model protocell membrane growth and division. The growth of large multilamellar fatty acid vesicles fed with fatty acid micelles, in a solution where solute permeation across the membranes is slow, results in the transformation of initially spherical vesicles into long thread-like vesicles, a process driven by the transient imbalance between surface area and volume growth. Modest shear forces are then sufficient to cause the thread-like vesicles to divide into multiple daughter vesicles without loss of internal contents. In an environment of gentle shear, protocell growth and division are thus coupled processes. We show that model protocells can proceed through multiple cycles of reproduction. Encapsulated RNA molecules, representing a primitive genome, are distributed to the daughter vesicles. Our observations bring us closer to the laboratory synthesis of a complete protocell consisting of a self-replicating genome and a self-replicating membrane compartment. In addition, the robustness and simplicity of this pathway suggests that similar processes might have occurred under the prebiotic conditions of the early Earth.},

We have proposed that a simple primitive cell, or protocell, would consist of two key components: a protocell membrane that defines a spatially localized compartment, and an informational polymer that allows for the replication and inheritance of functional information. Recent studies of vesicles composed of fatty-acid membranes have shed considerable light on pathways for protocell growth and division, as well as means by which protocells could take up nutrients from their environment. Additional work with genetic polymers has provided insight into the potential for chemical genome replication and compatibility with membrane encapsulation. The integration of a dynamic fatty-acid compartment with robust, generalized genetic polymer replication would yield a laboratory model of a protocell with the potential for classical Darwinian biological evolution, and may help to evaluate potential pathways for the emergence of life on the early Earth. Here we discuss efforts to devise such an integrated protocell model.},

Because no modern-day terrestrial hydrothermal systems are free from the influence of organic compounds derived from biologic processes, laboratory experiments provide the best opportunity for confirmation of the potential for organic synthesis in hydrothermal systems. Here we report on the formation of lipid compounds during Fischer-Tropsch-type synthesis from aqueous solutions of formic acid or oxalic acid. Optimum synthesis occurs in stainless steel vessels by heating at 175 degrees C for 2-3 days and produces lipid compounds ranging from C2 to {\textgreater} C35 which consist of n-alkanols, n-alkanoic acids, n-alkenes, n-alkanes and alkanones. The precursor carbon sources used are either formic acid or oxalic acid, which disproportionate to H2, CO2 and probably CO. Both carbon sources yield the same lipid classes with essentially the same ranges of compounds. The synthesis reactions were confirmed by using 13C labeled precursor acids.},

The key to resolving this mystery lies in the simplicity of the earliest living cells, together with the ability of the appropriate molecular building blocks to spontaneously self-assemble into larger structures. In our view, the two key components of a primitive cell are not only self-assembling, but also self-replicating, structures: the nucleic acid genome and the cell membrane. Here, we summarize recent experimental progress toward the synthesis of efficient self-replicating nucleic acid and membrane vesicle systems and discuss some of the issues that arise during efforts to integrate these two subsystems into a coherent whole. We have shown that spontaneous nucleic-acid-copying chemistry can take place within membrane vesicles, using externally supplied activated nucleotides as substrates. Thus, membranes need not be a barrier to the uptake of environmentally supplied nutrients. We examine some of the remaining obstacles that must be overcome to enable the synthesis of a complete self-replicating protocell, and we discuss the implications of these experiments for our understanding of the emergence of Darwinian evolution and the origin and early evolution of cellular life.},

We investigated all clusters and phylogenetic trees for 6.1 million protein coding genes from sequenced prokaryotic genomes in order to reconstruct the microbial ecology of LUCA. Among 286,514 protein clusters, we identified 355 protein families (∼0.1\%) that trace to LUCA by phylogenetic criteria. Because these proteins are not universally distributed, they can shed light on LUCA's physiology. Their functions, properties and prosthetic groups depict LUCA as anaerobic, CO2-fixing, H2-dependent with a Wood–Ljungdahl pathway, N2-fixing and thermophilic. LUCA's biochemistry was replete with FeS clusters and radical reaction mechanisms. Its cofactors reveal dependence upon transition metals, flavins, S-adenosyl methionine, coenzyme A, ferredoxin, molybdopterin, corrins and selenium. Its genetic code required nucleoside modifications and S-adenosyl methionine-dependent methylations. The 355 phylogenies identify clostridia and methanogens, whose modern lifestyles resemble that of LUCA, as basal among their respective domains. LUCA inhabited a geochemically active environment rich in H2, CO2 and iron. The data support the theory of an autotrophic origin of life involving the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway in a hydrothermal setting.},

After an initial hot period, surface temperatures in the late Hadean may have been clement beneath an atmosphere containing greenhouse gases over an ocean-dominated planetary surface. The first crust was mafic and it internally melted repeatedly to produce the felsic rocks that crystallized the Jack Hills zircons. This crust was destabilized during late heavy bombardment. Plate tectonics probably started soon after and had produced voluminous continental crust by the mid Archean, but ocean volumes were sufficient to submerge much of this crust. In the Hadean and early Archean, hydrothermal systems around abundant komatiitic volcanism may have provided suitable sites to host the earliest living communities and for the evolution of key enzymes. Evidence from the Isua Belt, Greenland, suggests life was present by 3.8 Gya, and by the mid-Archean, the geological record both in the Pilbara in Western Australia and the Barberton Greenstone Belt in South Africa shows that microbial life was abundant, probably using anoxygenic photosynthesis. By the late Archean, oxygenic photosynthesis had evolved, transforming the atmosphere and permitting the evolution of eukaryotes.},

Using a comparative structural analysis approach, we identify a set of fundamental electron transfer modules that have evolved to form the extant oxidoreductases. Using transition metal-containing cofactors as fiducial markers, it is possible to cluster cofactor microenvironments into as few as four major modules: bacterial ferredoxin, cytochrome c, symerythrin, and plastocyanin-type folds. From structural alignments, it is challenging to ascertain whether modules evolved from a single common ancestor (homology) or arose by independent convergence on a limited set of structural forms (analogy). Additional insight into common origins is contained in the spatial adjacency network (SPAN), which is based on proximity of modules in oxidoreductases containing multiple cofactor electron transfer chains. Electron transfer chains within complex modern oxidoreductases likely evolved through repeated duplication and diversification of ancient modular units that arose in the Archean eon.},

Most modern oxidoreductases are complex in their structure and chemistry and must have evolved from a small set of ancient folds. Ancient oxidoreductases from the Archean Eon between ca. 3.5 and 2.5 billion years ago have been long extinct, making it challenging to retrace evolution by sequence-based phylogeny or ancestral sequence reconstruction. However, three-dimensional topologies of proteins change more slowly than sequences. Using comparative structure and sequence profile-profile alignments, we quantify the similarity between proximal cofactor-binding folds and show that they are derived from a common ancestor. We discovered that two recurring folds were central to the origin of metabolism: ferredoxin and Rossmann-like folds. In turn, these two folds likely shared a common ancestor that, through duplication, recruitment, and diversification, evolved to facilitate electron transfer and catalysis at a very early stage in the origin of metabolism.},

	abstract = {The mineralogy of terrestrial planets evolves as a consequence of a range of physical, chemical, and biological processes. In pre-stellar molecular clouds, widely dispersed microscopic dust particles contain approximately a dozen refractory minerals that represent the starting point of planetary mineral evolution. Gravitational clumping into a protoplanetary disk, star formation, and the resultant heating in the stellar nebula produce primary refractory constituents of chondritic meteorites, including chondrules and calcium-aluminum inclusions, with {\textasciitilde}60 different mineral phases. Subsequent aqueous and thermal alteration of chondrites, asteroidal accretion and differentiation, and the consequent formation of achondrites results in a mineralogical repertoire limited to {\textasciitilde}250 different minerals found in unweathered meteorite samples.

Following planetary accretion and differentiation, the initial mineral evolution of Earth’s crust depended on a sequence of geochemical and petrologic processes, including volcanism and degassing, fractional crystallization, crystal settling, assimilation reactions, regional and contact metamorphism, plate tectonics, and associated large-scale fluid-rock interactions. These processes produced the first continents with their associated granitoids and pegmatites, hydrothermal ore deposits, metamorphic terrains, evaporites, and zones of surface weathering, and resulted in an estimated 1500 different mineral species. According to some origin-of-life scenarios, a planet must progress through at least some of these stages of chemical processing as a prerequisite for life.

Biological processes began to affect Earth’s surface mineralogy by the Eoarchean Era ({\textasciitilde}3.85–3.6 Ga), when large-scale surface mineral deposits, including banded iron formations, were precipitated under the influences of changing atmospheric and ocean chemistry. The Paleoproterozoic “Great Oxidation Event” ({\textasciitilde}2.2 to 2.0 Ga), when atmospheric oxygen may have risen to {\textgreater}1\% of modern levels, and the Neoproterozoic increase in atmospheric oxygen, which followed several major glaciation events, ultimately gave rise to multicellular life and skeletal biomineralization and irreversibly transformed Earth’s surface mineralogy. Biochemical processes may thus be responsible, directly or indirectly, for most of Earth’s 4300 known mineral species.

The stages of mineral evolution arise from three primary mechanisms: (1) the progressive separation and concentration of the elements from their original relatively uniform distribution in the pre-solar nebula; (2) an increase in range of intensive variables such as pressure, temperature, and the activities of H2O, CO2, and O2; and (3) the generation of far-from-equilibrium conditions by living systems. The sequential evolution of Earth’s mineralogy from chondritic simplicity to Phanerozoic complexity introduces the dimension of geologic time to mineralogy and thus provides a dynamic alternate approach to framing, and to teaching, the mineral sciences.},

	abstract = {The Hadean Eon, encompassing Earth's first 550 million years, was a time of significant planetary evolution. Nevertheless, prebiotic Earth's near-surface environment may have held no more than approximately 420 different rock-forming or accessory mineral species that were widely distributed and/or volumetrically significant. This relative Hadean mineralogical parsimony is a consequence of the limited modes of mineral paragenesis prior to 4 Ga compared to the last 3.0 billion years. Dominant Hadean Eon mineralizing processes include the evolution of a diverse suite of intrusive and extrusive igneous lithologies; hydrothermal alteration over a wide temperature range, notably serpentinization; authigenesis in marine sediments; diagenesis and low-grade metamorphism in near-surface environments; and impact-related processes, including shock mineralization, creation of marginal hydrothermal zones, and excavation of deep metamorphosed terrains. On the other hand, the Hadean Eon may have been notably lacking in mineralization generated by plate tectonic processes, such as subduction zone volcanism and associated fluid-rock interactions, which result in massive sulfide deposition; convergent boundary orogenesis and consequent extensive granitoid-rooted continental landmasses; and the selection and concentration of incompatible elements in complex pegmatites, with hundreds of accompanying minerals. The dramatic mineralogical consequences of life are reflected in the absence of Hadean biomineralization; for example, the lack of extensive carbonate deposits and the associated restricted development of skarn and cave minerals prior to 4 Ga. Most importantly, it was not until after the establishment via photosynthesis of significant near-surface redox gradients that supergene alteration, redox-controlled ore deposition, and subaerial weathering in an oxidizing environment could diversify Earth's near-surface mineralogy. These post-Hadean processes may be responsible for over 4000 of the more than 4800 approved mineral species. Any scenario for life's origins that invokes minerals as agents of molecular synthesis, selection, protection, or organization must take into account the limited mineralogical repertoire of the time.},

We review here both published and previously unreported experimental data that provide new perspectives on this old proposal. The new data include evidence that, in the presence of borate, small amounts of carbohydrates can fix large amounts of formaldehyde that are expected in an environment rich in carbon dioxide. Further, we consider other species, including arsenate, arsenite, phosphite, and germanate, that might replace phosphate as linkers in genetic biopolymers. While linkages involving these oxyanions are judged to be too unstable to support genetics on Earth, we consider the possibility that they might do so in colder semi-aqueous environments more exotic than those found on Earth, where cosolvents such as ammonia might prevent freezing at temperatures well below 273 K. These include the ammonia-water environments that are possibly present at low temperatures beneath the surface of Titan, Saturn's largest moon.

	abstract = {The RNA World is generally thought to have been an important link between purely prebiotic ({\textgreater}3.7 Ga) chemistry and modern DNA/protein biochemistry. One concern about the RNA World hypothesis is the geochemical stability of ribose, the sugar moiety of RNA. Prebiotic stabilization of ribose by solutions associated with borate minerals, notably colemanite, ulexite, and kernite, has been proposed as one resolution to this difficulty. However, a critical unresolved issue is whether borate minerals existed in sufficient quantities on the primitive Earth, especially in the period when prebiotic synthesis processes leading to RNA took place. Although the oldest reported colemanite and ulexite are 330 Ma, and the oldest reported kernite, 19 Ma, boron isotope data and geologic context are consistent with an evaporitic borate precursor to 2400-2100 Ma borate deposits in the Liaoning and Jilin Provinces, China, as well as to tourmaline-group minerals at 3300-3450 Ma in the Barberton belt, South Africa. The oldest boron minerals for which the age of crystallization could be determined are the metamorphic tourmaline species schorl and dravite in the Isua complex (metamorphism between ca. 3650 and ca. 3600 Ma). Whether borates such as colemanite, ulexite and kernite were present in the Hadean ({\textgreater}4000 Ma) at the critical juncture when prebiotic molecules such as ribose required stabilization depends on whether a granitic continental crust had yet differentiated, because in its absence we see no means for boron to be sufficiently concentrated for borates to be precipitated.},

Reduction of phosphate to phosphite was likely widespread in the Archean, as the reaction occurs rapidly and is demonstrated from thermochemical modeling, experimental analogs, and detection of phosphite in early Archean rocks. We further demonstrate that the higher solubility of phosphite compared to phosphate results in the liberation of phosphorus from ferruginous sediments. This phosphite is relatively stable after its formation, allowing its accumulation in the early oceans. As such, phosphorus, not as phosphate but as phosphite, could have been a major nutrient in early pre-oxygenated oceans.},

	abstract = {Oxygen and silicon isotope compositions of cherts and studies of protein evolution have been interpreted to reflect ocean temperatures of 55-85 degrees C during the early Palaeoarchaean era ( approximately 3.5 billion years ago). A recent study combining oxygen and hydrogen isotope compositions of cherts, however, makes a case for Archaean ocean temperatures being no greater than 40 degrees C (ref. 5). Ocean temperature can also be assessed using the oxygen isotope composition of phosphate. Recent studies show that (18)O:(16)O ratios of dissolved inorganic phosphate (delta(18)O(P)) reflect ambient seawater temperature as well as biological processing that dominates marine phosphorus cycling at low temperature. All forms of life require and concentrate phosphorus, and as a result of biological processing, modern marine phosphates have delta(18)O(P) values typically between 19-26 per thousand (VSMOW), highly evolved from presumed source values of approximately 6-8 per thousand that are characteristic of apatite in igneous rocks and meteorites. Here we report oxygen isotope compositions of phosphates in sediments from the 3.2-3.5-billion-year-old Barberton Greenstone Belt in South Africa. We find that delta(18)O(P) values range from 9.3 per thousand to 19.9 per thousand and include the highest values reported for Archaean rocks. The temperatures calculated from our highest delta(18)O(P) values and assuming equilibrium with sea water with delta(18)O = 0 per thousand (ref. 12) range from 26 degrees C to 35 degrees C. The higher delta(18)O(P) values are similar to those of modern marine phosphate and suggest a well-developed phosphorus cycle and evolved biologic activity on the Archaean Earth.},

Such an opportunity is presented by detrital zircons more than 4 Gyr old found within 3-Gyr-old quartzitic rocks in the Murchison District of Western Australia. Here we report in situ U-Pb and oxygen isotope results for such zircons that place constraints on the age and composition of their sources and may therefore provide information about the nature of the Earth's early surface. We find that 3,910-4,280 Myr old zircons have oxygen isotope (delta18O) values ranging from 5.4+/-0.6\% to 15.0+/-0.4\%. On the basis of these results, we postulate that the approximately 4,300-Myr-old zircons formed from magmas containing a significant component of re-worked continental crust that formed in the presence of water near the Earth's surface. These data are therefore consistent with the presence of a hydrosphere interacting with the crust by 4,300 Myr ago.},

In the anoxic Fe2+-rich early oceans, these minerals would have been only partially oxidized and thus redox-active, perhaps able to promote prebiotic chemical reactions. We show that pyruvate, a simple organic molecule that can form in hydrothermal systems, can undergo reductive amination in the presence of mixed-valence iron oxyhydroxides to form the amino acid alanine, as well as the reduced product lactate. Furthermore, geochemical gradients of pH, redox, and temperature in iron oxyhydroxide systems affect product selectivity. The maximum yield of alanine was observed when the iron oxyhydroxide mineral contained 1:1 Fe(II):Fe(III), under alkaline conditions, and at moderately warm temperatures. These represent conditions that may be found, for example, in iron-containing sediments near an alkaline hydrothermal vent system. The partially oxidized state of the precipitate was significant in promoting amino acid formation: Purely ferrous hydroxides did not drive reductive amination but instead promoted pyruvate reduction to lactate, and ferric hydroxides did not result in any reaction. Prebiotic chemistry driven by redox-active iron hydroxide minerals on the early Earth would therefore be strongly affected by geochemical gradients of Eh, pH, and temperature, and liquid-phase products would be able to diffuse to other conditions within the sediment column to participate in further reactions.},

	abstract = {A shortened form of the self-splicing ribosomal RNA (rRNA) intervening sequence of Tetrahymena thermophila acts as an enzyme in vitro. The enzyme catalyzes the cleavage and rejoining of oligonucleotide substrates in a sequence-dependent manner with Km = 42 microM and kcat = 2 min-1. The reaction mechanism resembles that of rRNA precursor self-splicing. With pentacytidylic acid as the substrate, successive cleavage and rejoining reactions lead to the synthesis of polycytidylic acid. Thus, the RNA molecule can act as an RNA polymerase, differing from the protein enzyme in that it uses an internal rather than an external template. At pH 9, the same RNA enzyme has activity as a sequence-specific ribonuclease.},

Systematic detection and subsequent exclusion of products of horizontal gene transfer increased phylogenetic resolution, allowing us to confirm accepted relationships and resolve disputed and preliminary classifications. For example, we place the phylum Acidobacteria as a sister group of δ-Proteobacteria, support a Gram-positive origin of Bacteria, and suggest a thermophilic last universal common ancestor.
Sequences of 36 genes in each of 191 diverse species allow construction of a highly resolved phylogenetic tree, which, when lateral gene transfer is eliminated, clarifies the tree of life.

Biological redox reactions originally evolved in prokaryotes and ultimately, over the first ∼2.5 billion years of Earth's history, formed a global electronic circuit. To maintain the circuit on a global scale requires that oxidants and reductants be transported; the two major planetary wires that connect global metabolism are geophysical fluids—the atmosphere and the oceans. Because all organisms exchange gases with the environment, the evolution of redox reactions has been a major force in modifying the chemistry at Earth's surface. Here we briefly review the discovery and consequences of redox reactions in microbes with a specific focus on the coevolution of life and geochemical phenomena.},

But evidence of an even older crust is provided by detrital zircons in metamorphosed sediments at Mt Narryer3 and Jack Hills4,5,6,7,8 in the Narryer Gneiss Terrane9, Yilgarn Craton, Western Australia, where grains as old as ∼4,276 Myr have been found4. Here we report, based on a detailed micro-analytical study of Jack Hills zircons10, the discovery of a detrital zircon with an age as old as 4,404 ± 8 Myr—about 130 million years older than any previously identified on Earth. We found that the zircon is zoned with respect to rare earth elements and oxygen isotope ratios (δ18O values from 7.4 to 5.0‰), indicating that it formed from an evolving magmatic source. The evolved chemistry, high δ18O value and micro-inclusions of SiO2 are consistent with growth from a granitic melt11,2 with a δ18O value from 8.5 to 9.5‰. Magmatic oxygen isotope ratios in this range point toward the involvement of supracrustal material that has undergone low-temperature interaction with a liquid hydrosphere. This zircon thus represents the earliest evidence for continental crust and oceans on the Earth.},

However, missing from the caldera model were surface manifestations of the volcanic-hydrothermal system (hot springs, geysers) and their unequivocal link with life. Here we present new discoveries of hot spring deposits including geyserite, sinter terracettes and mineralized remnants of hot spring pools/vents, all of which preserve a suite of microbial biosignatures indicative of the earliest life on land. These include stromatolites, newly observed microbial palisade fabric and gas bubbles preserved in inferred mineralized, exopolymeric substance. These findings extend the known geological record of inhabited terrestrial hot springs on Earth by ∼3 billion years and offer an analogue in the search for potential fossil life in ancient Martian hot springs.},

However, many obstacles to interpretation of the fossils are overcome in the SPC because of the broad extent, excellent preservation and morphological variety of its stromatolitic outcrops—which provide comprehensive palaeontological information on a scale exceeding other rocks of such age. Here we present a multi-kilometre-scale palaeontological and palaeoenvironmental study of the SPC, in which we identify seven stromatolite morphotypes—many previously undiscovered—in different parts of a peritidal carbonate platform. We undertake the first morphotype-specific analysis of the structures within their palaeoenvironment and refute contemporary abiogenic hypotheses for their formation. Finally, we argue that the diversity, complexity and environmental associations of the stromatolites describe patterns that—in similar settings throughout Earth's history—reflect the presence of organisms.},

New geological proxies combined with models constrain atmospheric composition. They imply surface O2 levels {\textless}10−6 times present, N2 levels that were similar to today or possibly a few times lower, and CO2 and CH4 levels ranging {\textasciitilde}10 to 2500 and 102 to 104 times modern amounts, respectively. The greenhouse gas concentrations were sufficient to offset a fainter Sun. Climate moderation by the carbon cycle suggests average surface temperatures between 0° and 40°C, consistent with occasional glaciations. Isotopic mass fractionation of atmospheric xenon through the Archean until atmospheric oxygenation is best explained by drag of xenon ions by hydrogen escaping rapidly into space. These data imply that substantial loss of hydrogen oxidized the Earth. Despite these advances, detailed understanding of the coevolving solid Earth, biosphere, and atmosphere remains elusive, however.

Evaluation of potential solutions to the ‘faint young Sun’ hypothesis by determining the age of microbial methanogenesis has been limited by ambiguous geochemical evidence and the absence of a diagnostic fossil record. To overcome these challenges, we use a temporal constraint: a horizontal gene transfer event from within archaeal methanogens to the ancestor of Cyanobacteria, one of the few microbial clades with recognized crown-group fossils. Results of molecular clock analyses calibrated by this horizontal-gene-transfer-propagated constraint show methanogens diverging within Euryarchaeota no later than 3.51 billion years ago, with methanogenesis itself probably evolving earlier. This timing provides independent support for scenarios wherein microbial methane production was important in maintaining temperatures on the early Earth.},

	abstract = {The timing of the evolution of microbial life has largely remained elusive due to the scarcity of prokaryotic fossil record and the confounding effects of the exchange of genes among possibly distant species. The history of gene transfer events, however, is not a series of individual oddities; it records which lineages were concurrent and thus provides information on the timing of species diversification. Here, we use a probabilistic model of genome evolution that accounts for differences between gene phylogenies and the species tree as series of duplication, transfer, and loss events to reconstruct chronologically ordered species phylogenies. Using simulations we show that we can robustly recover accurate chronologically ordered species phylogenies in the presence of gene tree reconstruction errors and realistic rates of duplication, transfer, and loss. Using genomic data we demonstrate that we can infer rooted species phylogenies using homologous gene families from complete genomes of 10 bacterial and archaeal groups. Focusing on cyanobacteria, distinguished among prokaryotes by a relative abundance of fossils, we infer the maximum likelihood chronologically ordered species phylogeny based on 36 genomes with 8,332 homologous gene families. We find the order of speciation events to be in full agreement with the fossil record and the inferred phylogeny of cyanobacteria to be consistent with the phylogeny recovered from established phylogenomics methods. Our results demonstrate that lateral gene transfers, detected by probabilistic models of genome evolution, can be used as a source of information on the timing of evolution, providing a valuable complement to the limited prokaryotic fossil record.},

	abstract = {Atmospheric xenon is strongly mass fractionated, the result of a process that apparently continued through the Archean and perhaps beyond. Previous models that explain Xe fractionation by hydrodynamic hydrogen escape cannot gracefully explain how Xe escaped when Ar and Kr did not, nor allow Xe to escape in the Archean. Here we show that Xe is the only noble gas that can escape as an ion in a photo-ionized hydrogen wind, possible in the absence of a geomagnetic field or along polar magnetic field lines that open into interplanetary space. To quantify the hypothesis we construct new 1-D models of hydrodynamic diffusion-limited hydrogen escape from highly-irradiated CO2-H2-H atmospheres. The models reveal three minimum requirements for Xe escape: solar EUV irradiation needs to exceed 10× that of the modern Sun; the total hydrogen mixing ratio in the atmosphere needs to exceed 1\% (equiv. to 0.5\% CH4); and transport amongst the ions in the lower ionosphere needs to lift the Xe ions to the base of the outflowing hydrogen corona. The long duration of Xe escape implies that, if a constant process, Earth lost the hydrogen from at least one ocean of water, roughly evenly split between the Hadean and the Archean. However, to account for both Xe’s fractionation and also its depletion with respect to Kr and primordial 244Pu, Xe escape must have been limited to small apertures or short episodes, which suggests that Xe escape was restricted to polar windows by a geomagnetic field, or dominated by outbursts of high solar activity, or limited to transient episodes of abundant hydrogen, or a combination of these. Xenon escape stopped when the hydrogen (or methane) mixing ratio became too small, or EUV radiation from the aging Sun became too weak, or charge exchange between Xe+ and O2 rendered Xe neutral. In our model, Xe fractionation attests to an extended history of hydrogen escape and Earth oxidation preceding and ending with the Great Oxidation Event (GOE).},

This is the earliest evidence for the presence of methanogens, predating previous geochemical evidence by about 700 million years. It represents one of the earliest microbial processes identified in the geological record and suggests that methanogens may have played a role in regulating the climate on the Archaean Earth.},

This problem is nuanced in its practical details and the way attempted explanations feedback with questions and developments in other areas of science, including astronomy, biology, and planetary science. Prebiotic chemistry attempts to address this issue theoretically, experimentally, and observationally. The ease of formation of bioorganic compounds under plausible prebiotic conditions suggests that these molecules were present in the primitive terrestrial environment. In addition to synthesis in the Earth's primordial atmosphere and oceans, it is likely that the infall of comets, meteorites, and interplanetary dust particles, as well as submarine hydrothermal vent synthesis, may have contributed to prebiotic organic evolution. The primordial organic soup may have been quite complex, but it did not likely include all of the compounds found in modern organisms. Regardless of their origin, organic compounds would need to be concentrated and complexified by environmental mechanisms. While this review is by no means exhaustive, many of the issues central to the state of the art of prebiotic chemistry are reviewed here.},

The earliest known microfossils (˜3,500 Myr before present) are structurally complex, and if it is assumed that the associated organisms required a long time to develop this degree of complexity, then the existence of life much earlier than this can be argued1,2. But the known examples of crustal rocks older than ˜3,500 Myr have experienced intense metamorphism, which would have obliterated any fragile microfossils contained therein. It is therefore necessary to search for geochemical evidence of past biotic activity that has been preserved within minerals that are resistant to metamorphism. Here we report ion-microprobe measure-ments of the carbon-isotope composition of carbonaceous inclusions within grains of apatite (basic calcium phosphate) from the oldest known sediment sequences—a ˜3,800-Myr-old banded iron formation from the Isua supracrustal belt, West Greenland35, and a similar formation from the nearby Akilia island that is possibly older than 3,850 Myr (ref. 3). The carbon in the carbonaceous inclusions is isotopically light, indicative of biological activity; no known abiotic process can explain the data. Unless some unknown abiotic process exists which is able both to create such isotopically light carbon and then selectively incorporate it into apatite grains, our results provide evidence for the emergence of life on Earth by at least 3,800 Myr before present.},

Yet the geological record shows that liquid water was present. This is usually explained as the consequence of a greenhouse effect due to a high concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide and/or methane. Minik Rosing et al. suggest that there is no need to invoke greenhouse warming — and no climate paradox. They demonstrate that the mineralogy of Archaean sediments is inconsistent with high greenhouse gas concentrations and the metabolic constraints of the methanogens of the time. They hypothesize that the low albedo of the early Earth, with little in the way of continents, and a preponderance of dark heat-absorbing ocean, together with a lack of biologically induced cloud condensation nuclei, were sufficient to maintain temperatures above freezing.},

This apparent conflict cannot be explained by the apparent inability of solar models to account for the low observed neutrino flux3. Even models that are forced to fit the neutrino data require a similar increase in the solar luminosity. As Newman and Rood1 state: “a faint young Sun is one of the most unavoidable consequences of stellar structure considerations”.

	abstract = {Carbon dioxide fixation is a polyphyletic trait that has evolved in widely 
separated prokaryotic branches. The three principal CO2-assimilation pathways are 
(i) the reductive pentose-phosphate cycle, i. e. the Calvin-Benson cycle; (ii) the 
reductive citric acid (or Arnon) cycle; and (iii) the net synthesis of acetyl-CoA from 
CO/CO2, or Wood pathway. Sequence analysis and the comparative biochemistry 
of these routes suggest that all of them were shaped to a considerable extent by the 
evolutionary recruitment of enzymes. Molecular phylogenetic trees show that the 
Calvin-Benson cycle was a relatively late development in the (eu)bacterial branch, 
suggesting that some form(s) of carbon assimilation may have been operative before 
chlorophyll-based photosynthesis. On the other hand, the ample phylogenetic 
distribution of both the Arnon and the Wood pathways does not allow us to infer 
which one of them is older. However, different lines of evidence, including 
experimental reports on the NiS/FeS-mediated C–C bond formation from CO and 
CH3SH are used here to argue that the first CO2-fixation route may have been a semienzymatic 
Wood-like pathway.},

These bubbles were inflated hydrostatically at sulphidic submarine hot springs sited some distance from oceanic spreading centers four billion years ago. The membrane enclosing the bubbles was precipitated in response to contact between the spring waters and the mildly oxidized, acidic and iron-bearing Hadean ocean water. As the gelatinous sulphide bubbles aged and were inflated beyond their strength they budded, producing contiguous daughter bubbles by the precipitation of new membrane. [Fe2S2]+/0 or [Fe4S4]2+/+ clusters, possibly bonded by hydrothermal thiolate ligands as proferredoxins, could have catalyzed oxidation of thiolates to disulphides, thereby modifying membrane properties.},

	abstract = {Discoveries demonstrating that RNA can serve genetic, catalytic, structural, and regulatory roles have provided strong support for the existence of an RNA World that preceded the origin of life as we know it. Despite the appeal of this idea, it has been difficult to explain how macromolecular RNAs emerged from small molecules available on the early Earth. We propose here a mechanism by which mutual catalysis in a pre-biotic network initiated a progression of stages characterized by ever larger and more effective catalysts supporting a proto-metabolic network, and the emergence of RNA as the dominant macromolecule due to its ability to both catalyze chemical reactions and to be copied in a template-directed manner. This model suggests that many features of modern life, including the biosynthetic pathways leading to simple metabolites, the structures of organic and metal ion cofactors, homochirality, and template-directed replication of nucleic acids, arose long before the RNA World and were retained as pre-biotic systems became more sophisticated.},

	abstract = {Since their discovery, hydrothermal vents have been relevant to concepts that surround the origin of life. At the simplest level, there are two kinds of hydrothermal vents: the hot (approximately 350°C) black smoker type, the chemistry of which is driven by the magma-chamber that resides below ocean-floor spreading zones, and the cooler (approximately 50–90°C) Lost City type, the chemistry of which is driven not by magma, but by a process called serpentinization.Serpentinization is a H2-producing geochemical reaction that has been operation in hydrothermal systems for as long as there has been water on the Earth. Its reducing power is sufficient to generate substantial amounts of abiogenic CH4 and short hydrocarbons in the effluent of some modern hydrothermal vents.In the study of the origin of life, major unresolved issues concern the source of sustained chemical energy and the source of reduced carbon compounds. The CO2-reducing geochemistry of modern hydrothermal vents provides a model for our understanding of how such processes might have been possible at the dawn of biochemistry.Methanogens and acetogens satisfy their carbon needs through the acetyl-coenzyme A pathway, an energy-releasing pathway of CO2 fixation, if given sufficient environmental H2 and CO2. The authors consider the idea that the CH4-producing and acetate-producing geochemistry of hydrothermal vents is the abiogenic precursor of modern microbial CH4 and acetate production.This suggests that the evolutionary starting point of microbial metabolism might have been an energy-releasing geochemical process in which CO2 served as the acceptor for electrons that stemmed from H2 generated by serpentinization. The naturally chemiosmotic nature of alkaline hydrothermal systems, such as Lost City, might be important to the origin of life issue, but in a somewhat unexpected way that, in turn, helps to explain why chemiosmotic coupling through ATPases is universal throughout the microbial world.},

Here we report the discovery of an extensive hydrothermal field at 30° N near the eastern intersection of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and the Atlantis fracture zone. The vent field—named ‘Lost City’—is distinctly different from all other known sea-floor hydrothermal fields in that it is located on 1.5-Myr-old crust, nearly 15 km from the spreading axis, and may be driven by the heat of exothermic serpentinization reactions between sea water and mantle rocks. It is located on a dome-like massif and is dominated by steep-sided carbonate chimneys, rather than the sulphide structures typical of ‘black smoker’ hydrothermal fields. We found that vent fluids are relatively cool (40–75 °C) and alkaline (pH 9.0–9.8), supporting dense microbial communities that include anaerobic thermophiles. Because the geological characteristics of the Atlantis massif are similar to numerous areas of old crust along the Mid-Atlantic, Indian and Arctic ridges, these results indicate that a much larger portion of the oceanic crust may support hydrothermal activity and microbial life than previously thought.},

Then, as now, they encompassed a multiplicity of physical and chemical gradients as a direct result of interactions between extensive hydrothermal activity in the Earth's crust and the overlying oceanic and atmospheric environments. We have proposed that these gradients provided the necessary multiple pathways for the abiotic synthesis of chemical compounds, origin and evolution of ‘precells’ and ‘precell’ communities and, ultimately, the evolution of free-living organisms. This hypothesis is consistent with the tectonic, paleontological, and degassing history of the earth and with the use of thermal energy sources in the laboratory to synthesize amino acids and complex organic compounds. In this paper, we expand upon the geophysical, chemical, and possible microbiological analogies between contemporary and Archean hydrothermal systems and suggest several hypotheses, related to our model for the origin and evolution of life at Archean vents, which can be tested in present-day hydrothermal systems.},

	abstract = {We simulate molecular transport in elongated hydrothermal pore systems influenced by a thermal gradient. We find extreme accumulation of molecules in a wide variety of plugged pores. The mechanism is able to provide highly concentrated single nucleotides, suitable for operations of an RNA world at the origin of life. It is driven solely by the thermal gradient across a pore. On the one hand, the fluid is shuttled by thermal convection along the pore, whereas on the other hand, the molecules drift across the pore, driven by thermodiffusion. As a result, millimeter-sized pores accumulate even single nucleotides more than 108-fold into micrometer-sized regions. The enhanced concentration of molecules is found in the bulk water near the closed bottom end of the pore. Because the accumulation depends exponentially on the pore length and temperature difference, it is considerably robust with respect to changes in the cleft geometry and the molecular dimensions. Whereas thin pores can concentrate only long polynucleotides, thicker pores accumulate short and long polynucleotides equally well and allow various molecular compositions. This setting also provides a temperature oscillation, shown previously to exponentially replicate DNA in the protein-assisted PCR. Our results indicate that, for life to evolve, complicated active membrane transport is not required for the initial steps. We find that interlinked mineral pores in a thermal gradient provide a compelling high-concentration starting point for the molecular evolution of life.},

All organized and dynamic elements of creation, from the galactic to the atomic, can be viewed as powered by, or being the result of, engines of disequilibria conversion; each a link in a great hierarchical cascade of conversions. There is, however, widespread misunderstanding about how disequilibria conversions happen–and indeed about what physically causes them to happen–especially regarding the role of energy and of the physical meaning of free energy. We attempt here to describe and justify what we assert is the correct alternative view of how phenomena are powered in nature, focusing especially on the molecular-level conversion processes (often called “energy conserving”) that power life and that must, then acting in an entirely abiotic context, have driven it first into being.},

The bombardment also delivered and redistributed to the surface large quantities of sulfur, one of the most important elements for life.

	abstract = {Water strongly influences the physical properties of the mantle and enhances its ability to melt or convect. Its presence can also be used to trace recycling of surface reservoirs down to the deep mantle1, which makes knowledge of the water content in the Earth's interior and its evolution crucial for understanding global geodynamics. Komatiites (MgO-rich ultramafic magmas) result from a high degree of mantle melting at high pressures2 and thus are excellent probes of the chemical composition and water contents of the deep mantle. An excess of water over elements that show similar geochemical behaviour during mantle melting (for example, cerium) was recently found in melt inclusions in the most magnesium-rich olivine in 2.7-billion-year-old komatiites from Canada3 and Zimbabwe4. These data were taken as evidence for a deep hydrated mantle reservoir, probably the transition zone, in the Neoarchaean era (2.8 to 2.5 billion years ago). Here we confirm the mantle source of this water by measuring deuterium-to-hydrogen ratios in these melt inclusions and present similar data for 3.3-billion-year-old komatiites from the Barberton greenstone belt. From the hydrogen isotope ratios, we show that the mantle sources of these melts contained excess water, which implies that a deep hydrous mantle reservoir has been present in the Earth's interior since at least the Palaeoarchaean era (3.6 to 3.2 billion years ago). The reconstructed initial hydrogen isotope composition of komatiites is more depleted in deuterium than surface reservoirs or typical mantle but resembles that of oceanic crust that was initially altered by seawater and then dehydrated during subduction. Together with an excess of chlorine and depletion of lead in the mantle sources of komatiites, these results indicate that seawater-altered lithosphere recycling into the deep mantle, arguably by subduction, started before 3.3 billion years ago.},

Beginning as early as ca. 4.3 Ga, but becoming more pronounced in the mid-Archean, a peraluminous signature begins to emerge from the JH zircon record. Combined with trace elements (P, REEs) and Ti-in-zircon thermometry, this increase in peraluminosity is likely the result of deep ({\textgreater}7 kbar) partial melting of hydrous mafic protoliths or partial melting of metasedimentary source material. In a geodynamic context, these results may suggest a gradual shift from a vertical tectonic regime toward a horizontal tectonic regime with potential subduction-like or collisional processes creating the necessary conditions for peraluminous melt generation beginning locally at least by ∼3.6 billion years ago (Ga).},

	abstract = {The concentration of atmospheric oxygen (pO2) is thought to have increased throughout Earth history, punctuated by rapid increases ca. 2.4 and 0.8 billion years ago near the beginning and end of the Proterozoic Eon. As photosynthesis is the largest source of free O2, the reigning paradigm of rising O2 levels centres around biologic metabolism. Here we show that the phosphorus content of igneous rocks correlates, in a first-order sense, with secular increases in O2 through time, suggesting that rising O2 levels are affected by long-term mantle cooling and its effect on the continental phosphorus inventory. Because phosphorus is the limiting nutrient for primary productivity, its availability has fundamental control over the efficiency of oxygenic photosynthesis, pointing to a previously unrecognized role of the solid Earth in biologic and atmospheric evolution. Furthermore, as many bio-essential elements are effectively incompatible in the mantle, this relationship has implications for any terrestrial planet. All planets will cool, and those with efficient plate tectonic convection will cool more rapidly. We are left concluding that the speed of such cooling may affect pattern of biological evolution on any habitable planet.},

Only fructose-1,6-diphosphate, formate, and lactate had higher specific activities than the acetate. The specific activities and distribution of C(14) in the fructose-6-phosphate and ribose-5-phosphate were such that we conclude that the synthesis of acetate does not occur via a pathway involving the sugar phosphates as direct intermediates. Likewise, it is shown that pathways including lactate, aspartate, serine, glycine, malate, and succinate are not of importance in the synthesis of acetate from CO(2).

Here, we focus on the latter mechanism which usually receives less attention. To better understand the possible advantages of the ‘reduction-first’ approach, we compare the two general strategies according to the kinetics of the CO2-capturing enzymes, and the resource consumption of the subsequent pathways. We show that the best CO2 reducing enzymes can compete with the best carboxylases. We further demonstrate that pathways that fix CO2 by first reducing it to formate could have an advantage over the majority of their carboxylation-only counterparts in terms of ATP-efficiency and hence biomass yield. We discuss and elaborate on the challenges of implementing ‘reduction-first’ pathways, including the thermodynamic barrier of CO2 reduction. We believe that pathways based on CO2 reduction are a valuable addition to nature's arsenal for capturing inorganic carbon and could provide promising metabolic solutions that have been previously overlooked.},

If it existed, a primordial version of the rTCA cycle would necessarily have been catalysed by naturally occurring minerals at the earliest stage of the transition from geochemistry to biochemistry. Here, we report non-enzymatic promotion of multiple reactions of the rTCA cycle in consecutive sequence, whereby 6 of its 11 reactions were promoted by Zn2+, Cr3+ and Fe0 in an acidic aqueous solution. Two distinct three-reaction sequences were achieved under a common set of conditions. Selectivity was observed for reduction reactions producing rTCA cycle intermediates compared with those leading off-cycle. Reductive amination of ketoacids to furnish amino acids was observed under similar conditions. The emerging reaction network supports the feasibility of primitive anabolism in an acidic, metal-rich reducing environment.},

	abstract = {We address the first several hundred million years of Earth’s history. The Moon-forming impact left Earth enveloped in a hot silicate atmosphere that cooled and condensed over ∼1,000 yrs. As it cooled the Earth degassed its volatiles into the atmosphere. It took another ∼2 Myrs for the magma ocean to freeze at the surface. The cooling rate was determined by atmospheric thermal blanketing. Tidal heating by the new Moon was a major energy source to the magma ocean. After the mantle solidified geothermal heat became climatologically insignificant, which allowed the steam atmosphere to condense, and left behind a ∼100 bar, ∼500 K CO2 atmosphere. Thereafter cooling was governed by how quickly CO2 was removed from the atmosphere. If subduction were efficient this could have taken as little as 10 million years. In this case the faint young Sun suggests that a lifeless Earth should have been cold and its oceans white with ice. But if carbonate subduction were inefficient the CO2 would have mostly stayed in the atmosphere, which would have kept the surface near ∼500 K for many tens of millions of years. Hydrous minerals are harder to subduct than carbonates and there is a good chance that the Hadean mantle was dry. Hadean heat flow was locally high enough to ensure that any ice cover would have been thin ({\textless}5 m) in places. Moreover hundreds or thousands of asteroid impacts would have been big enough to melt the ice triggering brief impact summers. We suggest that plate tectonics as it works now was inadequate to handle typical Hadean heat flows of 0.2–0.5 W/m2. In its place we hypothesize a convecting mantle capped by a ∼100 km deep basaltic mush that was relatively permeable to heat flow. Recycling and distillation of hydrous basalts produced granitic rocks very early, which is consistent with preserved {\textgreater}4 Ga detrital zircons. If carbonates in oceanic crust subducted as quickly as they formed, Earth could have been habitable as early as 10–20 Myrs after the Moon-forming impact.},

This realization has important consequences. On the one hand, sufficiently large and fast impactors can erode planetary atmospheres, and the very largest of these may have sterilized the surface of the Earth. In this regard, deep-sea hydrothermal vents become especially interesting for the history of early life, as they provide an environment protected against all but the greatest impact devastation. At the same time, impactors would have been delivering key biogenic elements (such as carbon and nitrogen) to Earth's surface, and (with much greater difficulty) intact organic molecules as well. Estimates of the various sources of prebiotic organics suggest that the heavy bombardment either produced or delivered quantities of organics comparable to those produced by other energy sources. However, substantial uncertainties exist. After reviewing the current understanding of the role of the heavy bombardment in the origins of life, a number of remaining key uncertainties are considered, and attempts are made to both quantify their magnitude and point to means of resolving them.},

	abstract = {Recently the single-impact hypothesis for forming the Moon has gained some favorable attention. We present in this paper a series of three-dimensional numerical simulations of an impact between the protoearth and an object about 0.1 of its mass. For computational convenience both objects were assumed to be composed of granite. We studied the effects on the outcome of the collision of varying the impact parameter, the initial internal energy, and the relative velocity. The results show that if the impact parameter is large enough so that the center of the impactor approximately grazes the limb of the protoearth, the impactor is not completely destroyed; part of it forms a clump in a large elliptical orbit about the Earth. This clump does not collide with the Earth, since the effects, first, of vapor pressure gradients during the impact, and later, of angular momentum transfer due to the rotation of the deformed Earth, have modified the ballistic trajectory. However, since the orbit of the clump comes close to the Earth (within the Roche limit) the clump will be destroyed and spread out to form a disk around the Earth. The amount of angular momentum in the Earth-Moon system thus obtained tends to fall short of the observed amount; this deficiency would be eliminated if the mass of the impactor were somewhat greater than the one assumed here. The scenario for making the Moon from a single-impact event is supported by these simulations.},

	abstract = {The fixation of into living matter sustains all life on Earth, and embeds the biosphere within geochemistry. The six known chemical pathways used by extant organisms for this function are recognized to have overlaps, but their evolution is incompletely understood. Here we reconstruct the complete early evolutionary history of biological carbon-fixation, relating all modern pathways to a single ancestral form. We find that innovations in carbon-fixation were the foundation for most major early divergences in the tree of life. These findings are based on a novel method that fully integrates metabolic and phylogenetic constraints. Comparing gene-profiles across the metabolic cores of deep-branching organisms and requiring that they are capable of synthesizing all their biomass components leads to the surprising conclusion that the most common form for deep-branching autotrophic carbon-fixation combines two disconnected sub-networks, each supplying carbon to distinct biomass components. One of these is a linear folate-based pathway of reduction previously only recognized as a fixation route in the complete Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, but which more generally may exclude the final step of synthesizing acetyl-CoA. Using metabolic constraints we then reconstruct a “phylometabolic” tree with a high degree of parsimony that traces the evolution of complete carbon-fixation pathways, and has a clear structure down to the root. This tree requires few instances of lateral gene transfer or convergence, and instead suggests a simple evolutionary dynamic in which all divergences have primary environmental causes. Energy optimization and oxygen toxicity are the two strongest forces of selection. The root of this tree combines the reductive citric acid cycle and the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway into a single connected network. This linked network lacks the selective optimization of modern fixation pathways but its redundancy leads to a more robust topology, making it more plausible than any modern pathway as a primitive universal ancestral form.},

This urge has led to an incessant stream of speculative ideas and debates on the evolution of photosynthesis that started in the first half of the twentieth century and shows no signs of abating. Some of these speculative ideas have become commonplace, are taken as fact, but find little support. Here, I review and scrutinize three widely accepted ideas that underpin the current study of the evolution of photosynthesis: first, that the photochemical reaction centres used in anoxygenic photosynthesis are more primitive than those in oxygenic photosynthesis; second, that the probability of acquiring photosynthesis via horizontal gene transfer is greater than the probability of losing photosynthesis; and third, and most important, that the origin of anoxygenic photosynthesis pre-dates the origin of oxygenic photosynthesis. I shall attempt to demonstrate that these three ideas are often grounded in incorrect assumptions built on more assumptions with no experimental or observational support. I hope that this brief review will not only serve as a cautionary tale but also that it will open new avenues of research aimed at disentangling the complex evolution of photosynthesis and its impact on the early history of life and the planet.},

These molecules are also part of the ancient acetyl-CoA pathway, an exergonic, H2-dependent, CO2 reducing metabolic pathway, which possibly dates back to the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA)3,26. In addition, the minerals within alkaline hydrothermal vents are rich in iron and nickel, two metals that are commonly found in the catalytic centers of modern-day enzymes, including the acetyl-CoA pathway27. They were also essential to catalyze CO2 reduction to synthesize more complex molecules such as pyruvate in the laboratory28,29. The idea that alkaline hydrothermal vents can be associated to an ancient metabolic pathway leads to an interesting argument for the location of the origin of metabolism. In this work I looked to expand the range of studies with hydrothermal conditions to new topics beyond CO2 reduction, exploring the effects of the complex microporous structure of these vents and if such rudimentary conditions could support modern day coenzymes and its redox reactions. For the first study an open microporous framework with zeolite and Laponite-RD was developed to simulate the vents’ structure and reproduced previous CO2 reduction experiments in this new setting. Secondly, the stability and reduction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) under hydrothermal conditions was studied, an ancient coenzyme essential for metabolism.Results suggest that the framework used promotes the synthesis of more complex molecules such as pyruvate and acetate, in detriment of the production of simpler ones such as formate and that NAD is not only stable in alkaline fluids, but also can be reduced in the presence magnetite (Fe3O4). Reducing contamination and improving analytic methods are important next steps to take for this work, which already presents an avenue that further connects alkaline hydrothermal vents to the origin of metabolism.},

	abstract = {The origin of oxygenic photosynthesis was the most important metabolic innovation in Earth history. It allowed life to generate energy and reducing power directly from sunlight and water, freeing it from the limited resources of geochemically derived reductants. This greatly increased global primary productivity and restructured ecosystems. The release of O2 as an end product of water oxidation led to the rise of oxygen, which dramatically altered the redox state of Earth's atmosphere and oceans and permanently changed all major biogeochemical cycles. Furthermore, the biological availability of O2 allowed for the evolution of aerobic respiration and novel biosynthetic pathways, facilitating much of the richness we associate with modern biology, including complex multicellularity. Here we critically review and synthesize information from the geological and biological records for the origin and evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis. Data from both of these archives illustrate that this metabolism first appeared in early Paleoproterozoic time and, despite its biogeochemical prominence, is a relatively late invention in the context of our planet's history.},

	abstract = {Recent re-evaluations of the geological record of the earliest life on Earth have led to the suggestion that some of the oldest putative microfossils1 and carbonaceous matter were formed through abiotic hydrothermal processes2,3. Similarly, many early Archaean (more than 3,400-Myr-old) cherts have been reinterpreted as hydrothermal deposits rather than products of normal marine sedimentary processes2,4,5. Here we present the results of a field, petrographic and geochemical study testing these hypotheses for the 3,416-Myr-old Buck Reef Chert, South Africa. From sedimentary structures and distributions of sand and mud, we infer that deposition occurred in normal open shallow to deep marine environments. The siderite enrichment that we observe in deep-water sediments is consistent with a stratified early ocean6,7. We show that most carbonaceous matter was formed by photosynthetic mats within the euphotic zone and distributed as detrital matter by waves and currents to surrounding environments. We find no evidence that hydrothermal processes had any direct role in the deposition of either the carbonaceous matter or the enclosing sediments. Instead, we conclude that photosynthetic organisms had evolved and were living in a stratified ocean supersaturated in dissolved silica8,9 3,416 Myr ago.},

	abstract = {The emergence of oxygen-producing (oxygenic) photosynthesis fundamentally transformed our planet; however, the processes that led to the evolution of biological water splitting have remained largely unknown. To illuminate this history, we examined the behavior of the ancient Mn cycle using newly obtained scientific drill cores through an early Paleoproterozoic succession (2.415 Ga) preserved in South Africa. These strata contain substantial Mn enrichments (up to ∼17 wt \%) well before those associated with the rise of oxygen such as the ∼2.2 Ga Kalahari Mn deposit. Using microscale X-ray spectroscopic techniques coupled to optical and electron microscopy and carbon isotope ratios, we demonstrate that the Mn is hosted exclusively in carbonate mineral phases derived from reduction of Mn oxides during diagenesis of primary sediments. Additional observations of independent proxies for O2—multiple S isotopes (measured by isotope-ratio mass spectrometry and secondary ion mass spectrometry) and redox-sensitive detrital grains—reveal that the original Mn-oxide phases were not produced by reactions with O2, which points to a different high-potential oxidant. These results show that the oxidative branch of the Mn cycle predates the rise of oxygen, and provide strong support for the hypothesis that the water-oxidizing complex of photosystem II evolved from a former transitional photosystem capable of single-electron oxidation reactions of Mn.},

Here we make an element-by-element journey through the periodic table and attempt to assess whether elements are essential or not, and if they are, whether there is a relevant code for them in the human genome. There are many difficulties such as the human biochemistry of several so-called essential elements is not well understood, and it is not clear how we should classify elements that are involved in the destruction of invading microorganisms, or elements which are essential for microorganisms with which we live in symbiosis. In general, genes do not code for the elements themselves, but for specific chemical species, i.e. for the element, its oxidation state, type and number of coordinated ligands, and the coordination geometry. Today, the biological periodic table is in a position somewhat similar to Mendeleev's chemical periodic table of 1869: there are gaps and we need to do more research to fill them. The periodic table also offers potential for novel therapeutic and diagnostic agents, based on not only essential elements, but also non-essential elements, and on radionuclides. Although the potential for inorganic chemistry in medicine was realized more than 2000 years ago, this area of research is still in its infancy. Future advances in the design of inorganic drugs require more knowledge of their mechanism of action, including target sites and metabolism. Temporal speciation of elements in their biological environments at the atomic level is a major challenge, for which new methods are urgently needed.},

But it took on new dimensions in the context of early twentieth-century microscophysics, with the progressive realisation that the physical laws governing the macroscopic world were not always adequate for describing the sub-microscopic one. The paper focuses on the researches of Jean Perrin in the 1900s, in particular his use of Brownian motion to produce evidence of the existence of atoms and in favour of the kinetic theory. His results were described by many contemporaries, and subsequently by historians, as the first direct proof of atomic and molecular reality. The paper examines the different strategies developed by Perrin for bridging the macro and sub-microphysical realms and making the latter accessible to the senses; even though neither atoms nor molecules were ever actually seen, and in fact very few visual representations were shown and published in connection with these experiments. This case provides a good example of how visualizing, representing and convincing could be interwoven in the production of evidence about the sub-microphysical realm circa 1900.},

	abstract = {The periodic table of elements is among the most recognizable image in science. It lies at the core of chemistry and embodies the most fundamental principles of science. In this new edition, Eric Scerri offers readers a complete and updated history and philosophy of the periodic table. Written in a lively style to appeal to experts and interested lay-persons alike, The Periodic Table: Its Story and Its Significance begins with an overview of the importance of the periodic table and the manner in which the term "element" has been interpreted by chemists and philosophers across time. The book traces the evolution and development of the periodic table from its early beginnings with the work of the precursors like De Chancourtois, Newlands and Meyer to Mendeleev's 1869 first published table and beyond. Several chapters are devoted to developments in 20th century physics, especially quantum mechanics and and the extent to which they explain the periodic table in a more fundamental way. Other chapters examine the formation of the elements, nuclear structure, the discovery of the last seven infra-uranium elements, and the synthesis of trans-uranium elements. Finally, the book considers the many different ways of representing the periodic system and the quest for an optimal arrangement.},

The motivation for the revision of the SI and the mole in particular will be explained and the experimental work that allowed it is summarized.},

	abstract = {Abstract The properties of elastic fluids (i.e. gases) depend especially on the facts that: (1) they possess weight; (2) they expand in all directions unless restrained; and (3) they allow themselves to be more and more compressed as the force of compression increases. These properties can be explained if we assume a fluid to consist of a very large number of small particles in rapid motion. If such a fluid is placed in a cylindrical container with a movable piston on which there rests a weight P, then the particles will strike against the piston and hold it up by their impacts; the fluid will expand as the weight P is moved or reduced, and will become denser if the weight is increased. We can find the relation between P and the density of the fluid by computing the effect of changing the volume underneath the piston. If the volume is decreased, the fluid will exert a greater force on the piston, first, because the number of particles is now greater in proportion to the smaller space in which they are confined, and secondly because any given particle makes more frequent impacts. If in addition we assume that the particles themselves are of negligible size, then it follows that the force of compression is approximately inversely proportional to the volume occupied by the air, if the temperature is fixed; and, if the temperature changes, the force of compression will also change, so that it will be proportional to the square of the velocity of the particles. This result enables us to measure the temperature of a gas by the pressure it exerts; the standard temperature from which the rest are measured should be obtained from boiling rainwater, because this no doubt has very nearly the same temperature all over the earth. Experiments to measure temperature and pressure are described. The theory is applied to atmospheric phenomena and to the firing of projectiles from cannons.},

In 1869, Andrews carried out the first accurate study on the effects of temperature and pressure on the behaviour of real gases, and in 1873, van der Waals formulated an equation capable of accounting for critical phenomena of each individual gas The nature of the intermolecular forces responsible for aggregation of gases was investigated in the early 20th century by Keesom and Debye (electrostatic interactions between dipoles) and by London (interaction between instantaneous dipoles, studied by quantum mechanics). The hydrogen bond theory, a particular case of dipolar interaction, originated in the 1920s in Berkeley in the institute directed by G. N. Lewis. Later it was made clear that hydrogen bonding is responsible for the aggregation of most biological systems, from proteins to nucleic acids. This Perspective describes the most significant steps through which the science of intermolecular interactions has progressed over the last two centuries, revisiting classical experiments and theoretical formulations, which led to the complex state of art of today.},

La existencia del Primum Firgidum, un cuerpo supremamente frío, fue objeto de mucha discussion entre filósofos y científicos hasta el siglo diecisiete. Aun cuando científicos famosos como Gay-Lussac negaron la posibilidad de un cero absoluto, la idea prendió de a poco y un gran número de valores diferentes fueron propuestos para su ubicacion bajo el punto de congelación del agua. Hubo que esperar hasta el trabajo funamental de Lord Kelvin para establecer la escala absoluta de temperatura que llevó al valor aceptado hoy en día de 273.15 C.},

And third, creation of a gaseous quantum fluid, with properties that are different from the quantum liquids helium-3 and helium-4. The field of Bose-Einstein condensation of atomic gases has continued to progress rapidly, driven by the combination of new experimental techniques and theoretical advances. The family of quantum-degenerate gases has grown, and now includes metastable and fermionic atoms.

In particular, we analyse the arguments invoked by Clausius between 1857 and 1862, and the motivation presented by Maxwell in 1860 to introduce his distribution of velocities. We first show that Maxwell's great insight seems to have been the recognition that the dynamical laws of molecular collision and thermal equilibrium could be made compatible only if the theory of heat became statistical. As for Clausius, historians of science have observed that in 1857 he used probabilities to bring regularity to the theory, but have not satisfactorily analysed important features of his use of probabilities in the context of the theory of heat. We show that only in 1862, in order to answer a criticism to his paper of 1858, Clausius gave a meaning to random motion, along the lines proposed by Maxwell, in his paper of 1860.},

	doi = {10.1002/pro.5560041001},
	abstract = {Native thermolysin binds a single catalytically essential zinc ion that is tetrahedrally coordinated by three protein ligands and a water molecule. During catalysis the zinc ligation is thought to change from fourfold to fivefold. Substitution of the active-site zinc with Cd2+, Mn2+, Fe2+, and Co2+ alters the catalytic activity (Holmquist B, Vallee BL, 1974, J Biol Chem 249:4601-4607). Excess zinc inhibits the enzyme. To investigate the structural basis of these changes in activity, we have determined the structures of a series of metal-substituted thermolysins at 1.7-1.9 A resolution. The structure of the Co(2+)-substituted enzyme is shown to be very similar to that of wild type except that two solvent molecules are liganded to the metal at positions that are thought to be occupied by the two oxygens of the hydrated scissile peptide in the transition state. Thus, the enhanced activity toward some substrates of the cobalt-relative to the zinc-substituted enzyme may be due to enhanced stabilization of the transition state. The ability of Zn2+ and Co2+ to accept tetrahedral coordination in the Michaelis complex, as well as fivefold coordination in the transition state, may also contribute to their effectiveness in catalysis. The Cd(2+)- and Mn(2+)-substituted thermolysins display conformational changes that disrupt the active site to varying degrees and could explain the associated reduction of activity. The conformational changes involve not only the essential catalytic residue, Glu 143, but also concerted side-chain rotations in the adjacent residues Met 120 and Leu 144. Some of these side-chain movements are similar to adjustments that have been observed previously in association with the "hinge-bending" motion that is presumed to occur during catalysis by the zinc endoproteases. In the presence of excess zinc, a second zinc ion is observed to bind at His 231 within 3.2 A of the zinc bound to native thermolysin, explaining the inhibitory effect.},

Taking the buffer dependences into account, the kcat/Km profile was explained by a simple bell-shaped curve with pKa1 = 5.0 and pKa2 = 8.25, at 25 degrees C. Both kcat and Km increased with pH at lower pH and took larger values for Fua-Gly-LeuNH2 than for Fua-Gly-PheNH2 at 25 degrees C. The pH dependence of inhibitory actions by amino acids and dipeptides, such as carbobenzyloxy-L-phenylalanine and L-phenylalanyl-L-leucinamide, showed characteristic features depending on their charge states: anionic or neutral ones inhibited the enzyme more strongly at lower pH while cationic ones did so at neutral pH. Temperature dependences of kcat/Km, Ki and the two pKa values in the kcat/Km profile were measured. The kcat/Km showed non-linear dependence while Ki increased linearly with temperature on a logarithmic scale. The calculated delta H values of deprotonation for pKa1 and pKa2 were 33.4 kJ/mol and 35.1 kJ/mol, respectively. The value for pKa1 is too large to be assigned to the carboxylic group of Glu-143, in contrast to the generally accepted view.

	abstract = {Zinc metalloenzymes play a major role in key biological processes and carboxypeptidase-A (CPA) is a major prototype of such enzymes. The present work quantifies the energetics of the catalytic reaction of CPA and its mutants using the empirical valence bond (EVB) approach. The simulations allow us to quantify the origin of the catalytic power of this enzyme and to examine different mechanistic alternatives. The first step of the analysis used experimental information to determine the activation energy of each assumed mechanism of the reference reaction without the enzyme. The next step of the analysis involved EVB simulations of the reference reaction and then a calibration of the simulations by forcing them to reproduce the energetics of the reference reaction, in each assumed mechanism. The calibrated EVB was then used in systematic simulations of the catalytic reaction in the protein environment, without changing any parameter. The simulations reproduced the observed rate enhancement in two feasible general acid-general base mechanisms (GAGB-1 and GAGB-2), although the calculations with the GAGB-2 mechanism underestimated the catalytic effect in some treatments. We also reproduced the catalytic effect in the R127A mutant. The mutation calculations indicate that the GAGB-2 mechanism is significantly less likely than the GAGB-1 mechanism. It is also found, that the enzyme loses all its catalytic effect without the metal. This and earlier studies show that the catalytic effect of the metal is not some constant electrostatic effect, that can be assessed from gas phase studies, but a reflection of the dielectric effect of the specific environment.

	abstract = {Most mycorrhizas are ‘balanced’ mutualistic associations in which the fungus and plant exchange commodities required for their growth and survival. Myco-heterotrophic plants have ‘exploitative’ mycorrhizas where transfer processes apparently benefit only plants. Exploitative associations are symbiotic (in the broad sense), but are not mutualistic. A new definition of mycorrhizas that encompasses all types of these associations while excluding other plant-fungus interactions is provided. This definition recognises the importance of nutrient transfer at an interface resulting from synchronised plant-fungus development. The diversity of interactions between mycorrhizal fungi and plants is considered. Mycorrhizal fungi also function as endophytes, necrotrophs and antagonists of host or non-host plants, with roles that vary during the lifespan of their associations. It is recommended that mycorrhizal associations are defined and classified primarily by anatomical criteria regulated by the host plant. A revised classification scheme for types and categories of mycorrhizal associations defined by these criteria is proposed. The main categories of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal associations (VAM) are ‘linear’ or ‘coiling’, and of ectomycorrhizal associations (ECM) are ‘epidermal’ or ‘cortical’. Subcategories of coiling VAM and epidermal ECM occur in certain host plants. Fungus-controlled features result in ‘morphotypes’ within categories of VAM and ECM. Arbutoid and monotropoid associations should be considered subcategories of epidermal ECM and ectendomycorrhizas should be relegated to an ECM morphotype. Both arbuscules and vesicles define mycorrhizas formed by glomeromycotan fungi. A new classification scheme for categories, subcategories and morphotypes of mycorrhizal associations is provided.},

	abstract = {Here, the coevolution of mycorrhizal fungi and roots is assessed in the light of evidence now available, from palaeobotanical and morphological studies and the analysis of DNA-based phylogenies. The first bryophyte-like land plants, in the early Devonian (400 million years ago), had endophytic associations resembling vesicular–arbuscular mycorrhizas (VAM) even before roots evolved. Mycorrhizal evolution would have progressed from endophytic hyphae towards balanced associations where partners were interdependent due to the exchange of limiting energy and nutrient resources. Most mycorrhizas are mutualistic, but in some cases the trend for increasing plant control of fungi culminates in the exploitative mycorrhizas of achlorophyllous, mycoheterotrophic plants. Ectomycorrhizal, ericoid and orchid mycorrhizas, as well as nonmycorrhizal roots, evolved during the period of rapid angiosperm radiation in the Cretaceous. It is hypothesised that roots gradually evolved from rhizomes to provide more suitable habitats for mycorrhizal fungi and provide plants with complex branching and leaves with water and nutrients. Selection pressures have caused the morphological divergence of roots with different types of mycorrizas. Root cortex thickness and exodermis suberization are greatest in obllgately mycorrhizal plants, while nonmycorrhizal plants tend to have fine roots, with more roots hairs and relatively advanced chemical defences. Major coevolutionary trends and the relative success of plants with different root types are discussed. Contents Summary 275 I. Introduction 276 II. Mycorrhizal Fungi 276 III.

	abstract = {Considering that the proton is a basic subatomic component of all ordinary matter — as well as being ubiquitous in its solo role as the hydrogen ion H+ — there are some surprising gaps in our knowledge of its structure and behaviour. A collaborative project to determine the root-mean-square charge radius of the proton to better than the 1\% accuracy of the current 'best' value suggests that those knowledge gaps may be greater than was thought. The new determination comes from a technically challenging spectroscopic experiment — the measurement of the Lamb shift (the energy difference between a specific pair of energy states) in 'muonic hydrogen', an exotic atom in which the electron is replaced by its heavier twin, the muon. The result is unexpected: a charge radius about 4\% smaller than the previous value. The discrepancy remains unexplained. Possible implications are that the value of the most accurately determined fundamental constant, the Rydberg constant, will need to be revised — or that the validity of quantum electrodynamics theory is called into question.},

Their biosynthetic machinery, represented by type I polyketide synthases (PKSs), has an architecture in which successive modules catalyse two-carbon linear extensions and keto-group processing reactions on intermediates covalently tethered to carrier domains. Here we used electron cryo-microscopy to determine sub-nanometre-resolution three-dimensional reconstructions of a full-length PKS module from the bacterium Streptomyces venezuelae that revealed an unexpectedly different architecture compared to the homologous dimeric mammalian fatty acid synthase. A single reaction chamber provides access to all catalytic sites for the intramodule carrier domain. In contrast, the carrier from the preceding module uses a separate entrance outside the reaction chamber to deliver the upstream polyketide intermediate for subsequent extension and modification. This study reveals for the first time, to our knowledge, the structural basis for both intramodule and intermodule substrate transfer in polyketide synthases, and establishes a new model for molecular dissection of these multifunctional enzyme systems.},

	abstract = {Medicinal plants have historically proven their value as a source of molecules with therapeutic potential, and nowadays still represent an important pool for the identification of novel drug leads. In the past decades, pharmaceutical industry focused mainly on libraries of synthetic compounds as drug discovery source. They are comparably easy to produce and resupply, and demonstrate good compatibility with established high throughput screening (HTS) platforms. However, at the same time there has been a declining trend in the number of new drugs reaching the market, raising renewed scientific interest in drug discovery from natural sources, despite of its known challenges. In this survey, a brief outline of historical development is provided together with a comprehensive overview of used approaches and recent developments relevant to plant-derived natural product drug discovery. Associated challenges and major strengths of natural product-based drug discovery are critically discussed. A snapshot of the advanced plant-derived natural products that are currently in actively recruiting clinical trials is also presented. Importantly, the transition of a natural compound from a “screening hit” through a “drug lead” to a “marketed drug” is associated with increasingly challenging demands for compound amount, which often cannot be met by re-isolation from the respective plant sources. In this regard, existing alternatives for resupply are also discussed, including different biotechnology approaches and total organic synthesis., While the intrinsic complexity of natural product-based drug discovery necessitates highly integrated interdisciplinary approaches, the reviewed scientific developments, recent technological advances, and research trends clearly indicate that natural products will be among the most important sources of new drugs also in the future.},

The 9 major inorganic ions found in blood plasma (Ca(2+), Na(+), Mg(2+), K(+), H(+), Cl(-), HCO(3)(-), H(2)PO(4)(-), and HPO(4)(2-)) are distributed unequally across the plasma membrane. This unequal distribution requires the energy of ATP hydrolysis through the action of the Na(+)-K(+) ATPase. The cell resting membrane potential in each of 3 different tissues with widely different resting membrane potentials has been shown to be equal to the Nernst equilibrium potential of the most permeant inorganic ion. The energy of the measured distribution of the 9 major inorganic ions between extra- and intracellular phases was essentially equal to the independently measured energy of ATP hydrolysis, showing that the distribution of these 9 major ions was in near-equilibrium with the ΔG' of ATP.

Here we describe a crystal structure of Na(+),K(+)-ATPase with bound ouabain, a representative cardiac glycoside, at 2.8 A resolution in a state analogous to E2.2K(+).Pi. Ouabain is deeply inserted into the transmembrane domain with the lactone ring very close to the bound K(+), in marked contrast to previous models. Due to antagonism between ouabain and K(+), the structure represents a low-affinity ouabain-bound state. Yet, most of the mutagenesis data obtained with the high-affinity state are readily explained by the present crystal structure, indicating that the binding site for ouabain is essentially the same. According to a homology model for the high affinity state, it is a closure of the binding cavity that confers a high affinity.},

In addition to maintaining physiological homeostasis of these solutes, increases and decreases in sodium may also initiate, directly or indirectly, signaling cascades that regulate a variety of intracellular post-translational events. In this review, we will describe how the Na+/K+ ATPase maintains a Na+ gradient utilized by multiple sodium-dependent transport mechanisms to regulate glucose uptake, excitatory neurotransmitters, calcium signaling, acid-base balance, salt-wasting disorders, fluid volume, and magnesium transport. We will discuss how several Na+-dependent cotransporters and Na+-dependent exchangers have significant roles in human health and disease. Finally, we will discuss how each of these Na+-dependent transport mechanisms have either been shown or have the potential to use Na+ in a secondary role as a signaling molecule.},

	abstract = {For the treatment of diseases, especially chronic diseases, traditional natural drugs have more effective therapeutic advantages because of their multi-target and multi-channel characteristics. Among many traditional natural medicines, resins frankincense and myrrh have been proven to be effective in the treatment of inflammation and cancer. In the West, frankincense and myrrh have been used as incense in religious and cultural ceremonies since ancient times; in traditional Chinese and Ayurvedic medicine, they are used mainly for the treatment of chronic diseases. The main chemical constituents of frankincense and myrrh are terpenoids and essential oils. Their common pharmacological effects are anti-inflammatory and anticancer. More interestingly, in traditional Chinese medicine, frankincense and myrrh have been combined as drug pairs in the same prescription for thousands of years, and their combination has a better therapeutic effect on diseases than a single drug. After the combination of frankincense and myrrh forms a blend, a series of changes take place in their chemical composition, such as the increase or decrease of the main active ingredients, the disappearance of native chemical components, and the emergence of new chemical components. At the same time, the pharmacological effects of the combination seem magically powerful, such as synergistic anti-inflammation, synergistic anticancer, synergistic analgesic, synergistic antibacterial, synergistic blood-activation, and so on. In this review, we summarize the latest research on the main chemical constituents and pharmacological activities of these two natural resins, along with chemical and pharmacological studies on the combination of the two.},

Doctors have concluded that the combined use of Xiaojin Pills with conventional therapy can significantly improve the efficacy with fewer side effects. However, the prescription of Xiaojin Pills is complicated and their quality control methods cannot completely ensure the quality of Xiaojin Pills. On the basis of its mechanism, our study combined chemical evaluation and biological evaluation to identify the anti-inflammatory markers of Xiaojin Pills. In this manuscript, 13 compounds in Xiaojin Pills were quantified. At the same time, the cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition rates of different Xiaojin Pills were measured and the possible markers were screened by spectrum-effect relationship. Further, anti-inflammatory activities of markers were verified and protein interaction network was analyzed, identifying the components of Protocatechuate, Beta-Boswellic acid and Levistilide A as the anti-inflammatory quality markers of Xiaojin Pills. We hope our studies can provide a scientific theoretical basis for accurately quality control of Xiaojin Pills and reasonable suggestions for pharmaceutical companies and new ideas for the quality control of other medicines.},

The ocean was weakly acid (pH ∼ 6), and a large pH gradient existed for nascent life with pH 9-11 fluids venting from serpentinite on the seafloor. Total CO(2) in water was significant so the vent environment was not carbon limited. Biologically important phosphate and Fe(II) were somewhat soluble during this period, which occurred well before the earliest record of preserved surface rocks approximately 3.8 billion years ago (Ga) when photosynthetic life teemed on the Earth and the oceanic pH was the modern value of approximately 8. Serpentinite existed by 3.9 Ga, but older rocks that might retain evidence of its presence have not been found.

The reaction mechanism of GAPDH entails phosphorolysis of a thioester to yield an energy-rich acyl phosphate bond, a chemistry that points to primitive pathways of energy conservation that existed even before the origin of the first free-living cells.

The concentration dependence of its reactions suggests it as a precellular bulk process. We propose that rTCA is statistically favored among competing redox relaxation pathways under early-earth conditions and that this feature drove its emergence and also accounts for its evolutionary robustness and universality. The ability to enhance the rate of core reactions creates an energetic basis for selection of subsequent layers of biological complexity.},

Many archaea live in volcanic habitats under such constraints, in high temperatures with only inorganic substances and often under anoxic conditions. In this Review, we describe the diverse carbon fixation mechanisms that are found in archaea.

In particular, the redox state of Earth's early atmosphere may have controlled greatly the efficiency of abiotic synthesis of biologically important organic compounds. However, the chemical composition of the Earth's early atmosphere has not been studied extensively before. In this study, we theoretically estimate the chemical composition of an atmosphere near the end of the completion of planetesimal accretion of the Earth. Our calculation results show that the Earth's early atmosphere is very reducing, rich in H2 and/or CH4, regardless of which meteoritic materials accrete and regardless of which chemical reactions control the molecular abundance in the atmosphere. In other words, impact-degassed origin of Earth's atmosphere leads inevitably to a reducing chemical composition, which is very favorable to efficient prebiotic synthesis of organic matter on Earth.},

	abstract = {Earth is the one known example of an inhabited planet and to current knowledge the likeliest site of the one known origin of life. Here we discuss the origin of Earth’s atmosphere and ocean and some of the environmental conditions of the early Earth as they may relate to the origin of life. A key punctuating event in the narrative is the Moon-forming impact, partly because it made Earth for a short time absolutely uninhabitable, and partly because it sets the boundary conditions for Earth’s subsequent evolution. If life began on Earth, as opposed to having migrated here, it would have done so after the Moon-forming impact. What took place before the Moon formed determined the bulk properties of the Earth and probably determined the overall compositions and sizes of its atmospheres and oceans. What took place afterward animated these materials. One interesting consequence of the Moon-forming impact is that the mantle is devolatized, so that the volatiles subsequently fell out in a kind of condensation sequence. This ensures that the volatiles were concentrated toward the surface so that, for example, the oceans were likely salty from the start. We also point out that an atmosphere generated by impact degassing would tend to have a composition reflective of the impacting bodies (rather than the mantle), and these are almost without exception strongly reducing and volatile-rich. A consequence is that, although CO- or methane-rich atmospheres are not necessarily stable as steady states, they are quite likely to have existed as long-lived transients, many times. With CO comes abundant chemical energy in a metastable package, and with methane comes hydrogen cyanide and ammonia as important albeit less abundant gases., Life probably arose on Earth after the moon-forming impact. It and subsequent impacts probably created transient reducing methane- or CO-rich atmospheres that provided abundant chemical energy.},

Likewise, it is usually conceded that the atmospheric greenhouse effect must have been higher in the past to offset reduced solar luminosity, but the levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases required remain speculative. A better understanding of past atmospheric evolution is important to understanding the evolution of life and to predicting whether Earth-like planets might exist elsewhere in the galaxy.},

	abstract = {Life is made of the intimate interaction of metabolism and genetics, both built around the chemistry of the most common elements of the Universe (hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon). The transmissible interaction of metabolic and genetic cycles results in the hypercycles of organization and de-organization of chemical information, of living and non-living. The origin-of-life quest has long been split into several attitudes exemplified by the aphorisms “genetics-first” or “metabolism-first”. Recently, the opposition between these approaches has been solved by more unitary theoretical and experimental frames taking into account energetic, evolutionary, proto-metabolic and environmental aspects. Nevertheless, a unitary and simple chemical frame is still needed that could afford both the precursors of the synthetic pathways eventually leading to RNA and to the key components of the central metabolic cycles, possibly connected with the synthesis of fatty acids. In order to approach the problem of the origin of life it is therefore reasonable to start from the assumption that both metabolism and genetics had a common origin, shared a common chemical frame, and were embedded under physical–chemical conditions favourable for the onset of both. The singleness of such a prebiotically productive chemical process would partake of Darwinian advantages over more complex fragmentary chemical systems. The prebiotic chemistry of formamide affords in a single and simple physical–chemical frame nucleic bases, acyclonucleosides, nucleotides, biogenic carboxylic acids, sugars, amino sugars, amino acids and condensing agents. Thus, we suggest the possibility that formamide could have jointly provided the main components for the onset of both (pre)genetic and (pre)metabolic processes. As a note of caution, we discuss the fact that these observations only indicate possible solutions at the level of organic substrates, not at the systemic chemical level.},

The Earth began hot after the moon-forming impact and cooled to the point where liquid water was present in ∼10 million years Subsequently, a few asteroid impacts may have briefly heated surface environments, leaving only thermophile survivors in kilometer-deep rocks. A warm 500 K, 100 bar CO2 greenhouse persisted until subducted oceanic crust sequestered CO2 into the mantle. It is not known whether the Earth's surface lingered in a ∼70°C thermophile environment well into the Archaean or cooled to clement or freezing conditions in the Hadean. Recently discovered ∼4.3 Ga rocks near Hudson Bay may have formed during the warm greenhouse. Alkalic rocks in India indicate carbonate subduction by 4.26 Ga. The presence of 3.8 Ga black shales in Greenland indicates that S-based photosynthesis had evolved in the oceans and likely Fe-based photosynthesis and efficient chemical weathering on land. Overall, mantle derived rocks, especially kimberlites and similar CO2-rich magmas, preserve evidence of subducted upper oceanic crust, ancient surface environments, and biosignatures of photosynthesis., Life probably first arose on Earth in or around rocks. Ancient mantle-derived rock, such as kimberlites, may retain “biosignatures” of early organisms.},

This conservation assessment analyzes 77 ecoregions across the southern, settled part of Canada to identify priorities for conservation action. Our analysis included 34 measures of biodiversity, threat and conservation response. We categorized all ecoregions based on their overall biodiversity and threat scores. This categorization identified nine “crisis ecoregions.” These ecoregions have higher biodiversity and threat scores compared to other ecoregions in the study area. These ecoregions represent less than 5\% of Canadian lands and inland waters but provide habitat for over 60\% of Canada’s species at risk. Twenty-one ecoregions have higher biodiversity but lower threat scores. Primarily distributed in the more intact portions of the study area, these ecoregions generally have lower biodiversity scores for species diversity, but score very high for intactness, habitat diversity and congregatory species. This assessment can help to contextualize existing and proposed conservation actions by highlighting key biodiversity, threat and conservation attributes of ecoregions across southern Canada. Our assessment can be used to focus efforts on new protected areas, species at risk recovery, capacity building and ecological monitoring. The results of the conservation assessment can be applied to set and track progress toward national, regional and organizational conservation goals, including post-2020 biodiversity targets. Regular reanalysis of the ecoregions to track their trends in biodiversity, threat and conservation responses will support monitoring the effectiveness of conservation programs and highlight ecoregions where continued focus is most needed to conserve Canada’s biodiversity.},

While ecological theory generalizes across taxa and environments, most empirical tests of factors controlling diversity and productivity have been observational, single-site experiments, or meta-analyses, limiting our understanding of variation among site-level responses and tests of general mechanisms. A synthesis of results from ten years of a globally distributed, coordinated experiment, the Nutrient Network (NutNet), demonstrates that species diversity promotes ecosystem productivity and stability, and that nutrient supply and herbivory control diversity via changes in composition, including invasions of non-native species and extinction of native species. Distributed experimental networks are a powerful tool for tests and integration of multiple theories and for generating multivariate predictions about the effects of global changes on future ecosystems.},

	abstract = {C4 photosynthesis is a series of anatomical and biochemical modifications that concentrate CO2 around the carboxylating enzyme Rubisco, thereby increasing photosynthetic efficiency in conditions promoting high rates of photorespiration. The C4 pathway independently evolved over 45 times in 19 families of angiosperms, and thus represents one of the most convergent of evolutionary phenomena. Most origins of C4 photosynthesis occurred in the dicots, with at least 30 lineages. C4 photosynthesis first arose in grasses, probably during the Oligocene epoch (24–35 million yr ago). The earliest C4 dicots are likely members of the Chenopodiaceae dating back 15–21 million yr; however, most C4 dicot lineages are estimated to have appeared relatively recently, perhaps less than 5 million yr ago. C4 photosynthesis in the dicots originated in arid regions of low latitude, implicating combined effects of heat, drought and/or salinity as important conditions promoting C4 evolution. Low atmospheric CO2 is a significant contributing factor, because it is required for high rates of photorespiration. Consistently, the appearance of C4 plants in the evolutionary record coincides with periods of increasing global aridification and declining atmospheric CO2. Gene duplication followed by neo- and nonfunctionalization are the leading mechanisms for creating C4 genomes, with selection for carbon conservation traits under conditions promoting high photorespiration being the ultimate factor behind the origin of C4 photosynthesis.

	abstract = {A study of the floristic composition and extent of the Rice Lake Plains in central southern Ontario was undertaken to provide a basis for protection and management and to contribute to a better understanding of pre-settlement vegetation. During field reconnaissance 42 remnant sites were discovered. Complete species lists were generated for 24 of these sites and a total of 260 native species was recorded of which 61 were present at more than half of the sites. Less than 10\% of the native flora of dry, open ground is believed to be extirpated. The most frequent species and those dominating many of the remnants included Andropogon gerardii, Carex siccata, Ceanothus americanus, Pteridium aquilinum, Sorghastrum nutans, and Toxicodendron rydbergii, all of which are characteristic dominants of tallgrass prairie and related habitats in the midwest. It is believed that both composition and frequency are much the same, but not exactly the same, as existed in pre-settlement times. A principal coordinate analysis based on Jaccard\&rsquo;s coefficient derived from a matrix of presence/absence data for 84 regionally rare species in 24 sites revealed three major groupings: (1) open sand and characteristic sand barren flora, including Dichanthelium sabulorum, Carex merritt-fernaldii, Cyperus lupulinus, Polygonum douglasii, Selaginella rupestris, and Sporobolus cryptandrus; (2) prairie sites with Desmodium canadense, Monarda fistulosa, Penstemon hirsutus, Ranunculus rhomboideus, and Schizachyrium scoparium; (3) high-diversity sites with savannah vegetation, including species characteristic of both prairie and open woodland, including Asclepias exaltata, Desmodium glutinosum, Erigeron pulchellus, Solidago arguta, and Taenidia integerrima. Correspondance analysis suggested a succession from sand barren to woodland and ordered species along a successional axis. In addition to three major associations, there was some regional variation with closer sites sharing species such as Lupinus perennis, Liatris cylindracea and Dichanthelium oligosanthes. The probable extent of plains vegetation revealed by remnants was determined by overlaying remnant sites on the soil landscapes and soil types to determine the extent of the associated soil or landscape thus providing a clue to the extent of the plains vegetation. Results of both the soil landscape and soil data analyses were subjected to restrictions based on exposure, elevation and historical information so as to develop a concept of minimum area. The minimum area of plains vegetation including prairie, sand barren and savannah was estimated to be 263 km2 on the basis of distribution of appropriate soils and 590 km2 on the basis of soil landscapes. Thus the Rice Lake Plains included an area of prairie, savannah and sand barrens approximately 600 km2 in extent and extending as an essentially continuous band 123 km long and up to 25 km wide along the top and north slope of the Oak Ridges Moraine from the Ganaraska Highland west of Rice Lake eastward to the Murray Hills and the Trent River and was one of the largest areas of plains vegetation in the eastern Great Lakes region.},

	abstract = {Aim National and international policy frameworks, such as the European Union's Renewable Energy Directive, increasingly seek to conserve and reference ‘highly biodiverse grasslands’. However, to date there is no systematic global characterization and distribution map for grassland types. To address this gap, we first propose a systematic definition of grassland. We then integrate International Vegetation Classification (IVC) grassland types with the map of Terrestrial Ecoregions of the World (TEOW). Location Global. Methods We developed a broad definition of grassland as a distinct biotic and ecological unit, noting its similarity to savanna and distinguishing it from woodland and wetland. A grassland is defined as a non-wetland type with at least 10\% vegetation cover, dominated or co-dominated by graminoid and forb growth forms, and where the trees form a single-layer canopy with either less than 10\% cover and 5 m height (temperate) or less than 40\% cover and 8 m height (tropical). We used the IVC division level to classify grasslands into major regional types. We developed an ecologically meaningful spatial catalogue of IVC grassland types by listing IVC grassland formations and divisions where grassland currently occupies, or historically occupied, at least 10\% of an ecoregion in the TEOW framework. Results We created a global biogeographical characterization of the Earth's grassland types, describing approximately 75\% of IVC grassland divisions with ecoregions. We mapped 49 IVC grassland divisions. Sixteen additional IVC grassland divisions are absent from the map because of the fine-scale distribution of these grassland types. Main conclusions The framework provided by our geographical mapping effort provides a systematic overview of grasslands and sets the stage for more detailed classification and mapping at finer scales. Each regional grassland type can be characterized in terms of its range of biodiversity, thereby assisting in future policy initiatives.},

	abstract = {Pollen diagrams from the Prairie Peninsula in Illinois record the climatically related vegetation shifts that have occurred since the late Pleistocene. They indicate that the major period of prairie development started between 8500 and 7900 BP, apparently occurring first along the southern margin. These events mark the beginning of the Hypsithermal interval and are correlated with the final disintegration of the Laurentide ice sheet and the establishment of the postglacial system of atmospheric circulation over North America. The late—glacial vegetation was spruce woodland in the north and open spruce woodland/tundra in central Illinois. These vegetation communities disappeared from the state in a northward direction between 14 000 and 10 900 BP. They were followed in northern Illinois by Pinus, Abies, Betula, and Fraxinus; in central Illinois Fraxinus expanded in the lowlands while the uplands remained relatively treeless. These assemblages, which persisted longer in the south than in the north, were subsequently replaced first by a mixture of cool temperate, then warm temperate deciduous trees as climatic amelioration continued. By 9000 BP, Illinois was dominated by deciduous forest. In response to Hypsithermal climatic stress, prairie vegetation began replacing deciduous forest about 8300 BP on the uplands in central Illinois and by 7900 BP xeric oak—hickory forest became dominant in northern Illinois. This is the beginning of the Prairie Peninsula as a discrete floristic area in Illinois. About 5000 BP the southern border of the Prairie Peninsula experienced increased moisture and renewed forest development suggesting a western contraction of the prairie margins. Central Illinois, however, remained grassland to the present. Between 900 and at least 400 yr ago an indicated trend toward cooler temperatures is correlated with late stages of the Neoglacial. Pollen evidence from northern Illinois and adjacent Lake Michigan indicates the reappearance or increase in Betula, Pinus, Picea and Larix. This short cool episode appears to end prior to the beginning of large—scale historic land clearance, about 140 yr ago, as the evidence for a vegetational readjustment to warmer climate is truncated by the logging of the forests, the plowing of the prairies and the resultant dramatic increase in Ambrosia pollen.},

Community definitions, a map of the real or potential extent of presettlement oak savanna, and location and description of high-quality savanna remnants are presented for each state. In 1985, 113 sites totaling more than 2,607 hectares of relatively high-quality oak savanna were located in the Midwest, approximately 0.02 percent of the presettlement extent of the community.},

Rock outcrop plant communities and serpentine barrens are of interest because they are refugia for endemic species adapted to extreme environmental conditions. Many of these communities have been reduced to less than one per cent of their original area and are imperiled ecosystems. This book provides a coherent, readable summary of the technical information available on savannas, barrens and rock outcrop plant communities. It is organized by region into four parts: eastern south-eastern region, central/midwest region, western/south-western region, and northern region. Written by internationally recognized regional specialists, each chapter includes a description of the climate, geology, soils associated with the community, and information about its historic and current vegetation.},

	abstract = {Grasslands are a widespread vegetation type that once comprised 42\% of the plant cover on earth's surface. Features commonly shared among grasslands are climates with periodic droughts, landscapes that are level to gently rolling, high abundances of grazing animals, and frequent fires. World-wide expansion of grasslands occurred 8 to 6 MaBP and was associated with increasing abundance of grasses using the C4 photosynthetic pathway, a decline in woodlands, and coevolution of mammals adapted to grazing and open habitats. Beginning with Transeau's seminal paper on the prairie peninsula in 1935, North American ecologists debated the relative importance of fire and climate in determining the distribution of grasslands. In the 1960's, a major research interest was the response of prairies to fire, especially the productivity of burned and unburned grasslands. Understanding mechanisms for increased productivity on burned prairies began in the late 1960's and continued into the middle 1980's. During the past 20 to 25 years, grassland research has focused on the coevolution of grasses and mammalian grazers and fire-grazing interactions that affect habitat heterogeneity and diversity across trophic levels. While this paper does not follow a chronological development of our understanding of grasslands, all of these major research interests are considered.},

The results of this preliminary study indicted significant losses of biodiversity at the ecosystem level in the United States.  The most substantial losses were summarized by listing ecosystems as critically endangered, endangered, and threatened.  More than 30 critically endangered, 58 endangered, and more than 38 threatened ecosystems were identified.

	abstract = {Plants respond to changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide. To herbivores, the decreased leaf protein contents and increased C/N ratios common to all leaves under elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide imply a reduction in food quality. In addition to these fine-scale adjustments, the abundance of C3 and C4 plants (particularly grasses) are affected by atmospheric carbon dioxide. C4 grasses currently predominate over C3 grasses in warmer climates and their distributions expand as atmospheric carbon dioxide levels decreased during glacial periods. C4 grasses are a less nutritious food resource than C3 grasses both in terms of reduced protein content and increased C/N ratios. There is an indication that as C4-dominated ecosystems expanded 6–8 Ma b.p., there were significant species-level changes in mammalian grazers. Today there is evidence that mammalian herbivores differ in their preference for C3versus C4 food resources, although the factors contributing to these patterns are not clear. Elevated carbon dioxide levels will likely alter food quality to grazers both in terms of fine-scale (protein content, C/N ratio) and coarse-scale (C3versus C4) changes.},

Based on historical land surveys and from early botanical accounts, the easternmost extent of these unique habitats was along the eastern flank of the Oak Ridges Moraine in an area known as the Rice Lake Plains. This area covered an estimated 15,384 to 30,300 hectares (38,000- 74,131 acres) (Carling and others 1992). The Rice Lake Plains harboured numerous savanna indicator species such as the extirpated Karner blue butterfly (Lycaeides melissa samuelis). In 2002, the Nature Conservancy of Canada purchased 316 ha (780 acres) on the Rice Lake Plains and initiated restoration plans. Bringing together multiple partners, NCC is leading the Rice Lake Plains Joint Initiative. This goal of the partnership is to raise the awareness of, and restore, the globally rare and provincially significant ecological communities and the species associated with them. To date, three years of funding has been secured. The Initiative involves the large-scale restoration of NCC lands and the assessment of over 2,400 hectares (6,000 acres) of adjacent lands. Restoration will include the removal of non-native species and prescribed burns. In addition, mapping and field inventories will be conducted on private lands on the Rice Lake Plains. Educational and communication opportunities will highlight this area to naturalists, landowners and local citizens and raise awareness of this globally rare habitat. Management plans are being developed for properties and will be used to generate a landscape conservation plan for the Rice Lake Plains.},

	abstract = {A two-year study was begun in 1985 to document and assess the highly significant natural history features of the Walpole Island Indian Reserve in southwestern Ontario, Canada. The northern part of the island complex, where extensive prairie, savannah, and hardwood communities remain, was divided into 30 areas. The southern part, consisting of agricultural lands and wetlands was not examined. Through intensive field study and literature search, over 800 vascular plant species have been recorded from Walpole. Of the total, 12\% (97) are rare in Ontario, and 1 \% (8) are not known elsewhere in Canada. Ninety-two species of birds have been confirmed as breeding, including 27 rare and one threatened species. An additional 44 species are probable breeders. Twenty-six species of herptiles were recorded including five of which are rare or declining. Twenty-four species of mammals have been recorded, including one rare species. Fifty-nine species of butterflies are known from Walpole Island, six of which are rare in Ontario. The results of this study confirm that Walpole Island contains the most significant tallgrass prairie and oak savannah, and associated flora and fauna remaining in Canada. Using six criteria, the 30 areas of the Island were priortized to provide the native people with a rationale for future conservation strategies.},

The purpose of this paper is to provide a past and present biological baseline by which to understand North American prairies and to provide a platform for future conservation. Events both immediate to the end of the Pleistocene and historic suggest that the present grassland conditions are different from those within which most of the grassland organisms evolved. Our analysis suggests that few grassland landscapes remain adequate in area and distribution to sustain diversity sufficient to include biota and ecological drivers native to the landscape. A robust and history-based scenario to conserve Great Plains grasslands is to 1) identify areas large enough to sustain an ecological system with all its biodiversity, 2) reverse significant losses in area of native grasslands, 3) ensure that restoration matches the grassland previously existing at that site, 4) refocus the profession of range management, and 5) establish a more meaningful agency design for grassland and natural resource management.},

	abstract = {Subfossil pollen and plant macrofossil data derived from 14C-dated sediment profiles can provide quantitative information on glacial and interglacial climates. The data allow climate variables related to growing-season warmth, winter cold, and plant-available moisture to be reconstructed. Continental-scale reconstructions have been made for the mid-Holocene (MH, around 6 ka) and Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, around 21 ka), allowing comparison with palaeoclimate simulations currently being carried out as part of the fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The synthesis of the available MH and LGM climate reconstructions and their uncertainties, obtained using modern-analogue, regression and model-inversion techniques, is presented for four temperature variables and two moisture variables. Reconstructions of the same variables based on surface-pollen assemblages are shown to be accurate and unbiased. Reconstructed LGM and MH climate anomaly patterns are coherent, consistent between variables, and robust with respect to the choice of technique. They support a conceptual model of the controls of Late Quaternary climate change whereby the first-order effects of orbital variations and greenhouse forcing on the seasonal cycle of temperature are predictably modified by responses of the atmospheric circulation and surface energy balance.},

	abstract = {Grasslands are globally extensive; they exist in many different climates, at high and low elevations, on nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor soils. Grassland distributions today are closely linked to human activities, herbivores, and fire, but many have been converted to urban areas, forests, or agriculture fields. Roughly 80\% of fires globally occur in grasslands each year, making fire a critical process in grassland dynamics. Yet, little is known about the long-term history of fire in grasslands. Here, we analyze sedimentary archives to reconstruct grassland fire histories during the Holocene. Given that grassland locations change over time, we compare several charcoal-based fire reconstructions based on alternative classification schemes: (a) sites from modern grassland locations; (b) sites that were likely grasslands during the mid-Holocene; and (c) sites based on author-derived classifications. We also compare fire histories from grassland sites, forested sites, and all sites globally over the past 12,000 years. Forested versus grassland sites show different trends: grassland burning increased from the early to mid-Holocene, reaching a maximum about 8000–6000 years ago, and subsequently declined, reaching a minimum around 4000 years ago. In contrast, biomass burning in forests increased during the Holocene until about 2000 years ago. Continental grassland fire history reconstructions show opposing Holocene trends in North versus South America, whereas grassland burning in Australia was highly variable in the early Holocene and much more stable after the mid-Holocene. The sharp differences in continental as well as forest versus grassland Holocene fire history trajectories have important implications for our understanding of global biomass burning and its emissions, the global carbon cycle, biodiversity, conservation, and land management.},

The biome distributions at 18 ka BP were probably as nearly in equilibrium with climate as are the modern distributions, but deglacial biomes were probably in disequilibrium. Ice sheet configuration was a strong control of climate until 7 ka BP. Regional climate trends can be inferred from changing biome distributions, but during periods of disequilibrium, biome distributions under-represent summer warming. Because of summer cooling by 2-4 °C during the Holocene, largely in the last 3-5 ka, middle and certain early Holocene biome distributions and species compositions are reasonable analogues of future equilibrium displacements due to equivalent warming, at least in areas that were long-since deglaciated. Past biome migration rates in response to rapid regional warming during deglaciation were mainly in the range of 100-200 m per year. If these rates pertain in the future, biomes may shift 10-20 km in most regions over the next century. A major impediment to using former Holocene conditions as a guide to future conditions is that warmer Holocene summers were accompanied by colder winters, whereas warmer future summers will be accompanied by warmer winters.},

	abstract = {1) Three indices of global climate have been monitored in the record of the past 450,000 years in Southern Hemisphere ocean-floor sediments.
2) Over the frequency range 10–4 to 10–5 cycle per year, climatic variance of these records is concentrated in three discrete spectral peaks at periods of 23,000, 42,000, and approximately 100,000 years. These peaks correspond to the dominant periods of the earth's solar orbit, and contain respectively about 10, 25, and 50 percent of the climatic variance.
3) The 42,000-year climatic component has the same period as variations in the obliquity of the earth's axis and retains a constant phase relationship with it.
4) The 23,000-year portion of the variance displays the same periods (about 23,000 and 19,000 years) as the quasi-periodic precession index.
5) The dominant, 100,000-year climatic
component has an average period close to, and is in phase with, orbital eccentricity. Unlike the correlations between climate and the higher-frequency orbital variations (which can be explained on the assumption that the climate system responds linearly to orbital forcing), an explanation of the correlation between climate and eccentricity probably requires an assumption of nonlinearity.
6) It is concluded that changes in the earth's orbital geometry are the fundamental cause of the succession of Quaternary ice ages.
7) A model of future climate based on the observed orbital-climate relationships, but ignoring anthropogenic effects, predicts that the long-term trend over the next several thousand years is toward extensive Northern Hemisphere glaciation.},

	abstract = {The spatio-temporal pattern of peak Holocene warmth (Holocene thermal maximum, HTM) is traced over 140 sites across the Western Hemisphere of the Arctic (0-180°W; north of ∼60°N). Paleoclimate inferences based on a wide variety of proxy indicators provide clear evidence for warmer-than-present conditions at 120 of these sites. At the 16 terrestrial sites where quantitative estimates have been obtained, local HTM temperatures (primarily summer estimates) were on average 1.6±0.8°C higher than present (approximate average of the 20th century), but the warming was time-transgressive across the western Arctic. As the precession-driven summer insolation anomaly peaked 12-10 ka (thousands of calendar years ago), warming was concentrated in northwest North America, while cool conditions lingered in the northeast. Alaska and northwest Canada experienced the HTM between ca 11 and 9 ka, about 4000 yr prior to the HTM in northeast Canada. The delayed warming in Quebec and Labrador was linked to the residual Laurentide Ice Sheet, which chilled the region through its impact on surface energy balance and ocean circulation. The lingering ice also attests to the inherent asymmetry of atmospheric and oceanic circulation that predisposes the region to glaciation and modulates the pattern of climatic change. The spatial asymmetry of warming during the HTM resembles the pattern of warming observed in the Arctic over the last several decades. Although the two warmings are described at different temporal scales, and the HTM was additionally affected by the residual Laurentide ice, the similarities suggest there might be a preferred mode of variability in the atmospheric circulation that generates a recurrent pattern of warming under positive radiative forcing. Unlike the HTM, however, future warming will not be counterbalanced by the cooling effect of a residual North American ice sheet.},

The transition from parkland to coniferous forest at ca. 12,500 yr B.P. occurred within a climate that was only gradually warming. By the time of the spruce/pine transition at 10,500 yr B.P., an insect fauna had become established that is typical of southwestern Ontario today.

	abstract = {Ecotones are areas of transition between ecological communities, ecosystems, or ecological regions (such as Mediterranean and desert). Ecotones often occur along ecological gradients. Such gradients are created as a result of spatial shifts in elevation, climate, soil, and many other environmental factors. Ecotones commonly coincide with areas of sharp climatic transition along environmental gradients. They occur at multiple spatial scales, from continental-scale transitions between major biomes to small-scale ecotones where local vegetation communities and microhabitats coincide. They show a diversity of boundary types that range from natural boundaries (e.g., altitudinal, latitudinal transitions) to human-generated ecotones (e.g., forest clear-cut edges or urban ecotones). Ecotones have been studied in the past four decades in an ecological context and in recent years are receiving increasing attention in the context of biodiversity conservation. Various studies have shown that species richness and abundances tend to peak in ecotonal areas, though exceptions to these patterns occur. Ecotones are “natural laboratories” for studying a range of evolutionary processes, such as the process by which new species form, also termed speciation. Some researchers argue that ecotones deserve high-conservation investment, potentially serving as speciation and biodiversity centers. Because ecotones are often small in size and relatively rich in biodiversity, conservation efforts in these areas may prove to be an efficient and cost-effective conservation strategy.},

During the 2001 and 2002 breeding seasons, we examined the relationship between bird communities and environmental variables, including vegetation characteristics and site prescribed-burn frequencies, across a habitat gradient in dry oak savannas in central Minnesota. The habitat gradient we studied went from: (1) prairie to (2) remnant oak savanna to (3) oak woodland undergoing savanna restoration via fire or mechanical removal of woody vegetation to (4) oak woodland. We conducted fixed-radius point counts (n = 120) within habitats with either prairie groundcover or predominately oak canopy. We described canopy and groundcover characteristics at a sub-sample (n = 28) of non-prairie points, and collected canopy and woody species richness data and prescribed-burn frequencies over the past 20 years for all points. Observed bird communities were most strongly correlated with canopy cover and burn frequency and, to a lesser extent, attributes of the shrub component. Most savanna points had bird communities that were distinct from those found at oak woodland or oak woodland points undergoing restoration via burning. Savanna points similar to oak woodland points were in areas managed by periodic cutting rather than burning. Remnant savanna bird communities were more strongly associated with prescribed burning than those in other habitat types, but it appeared that most oak woodlands that had undergone ≥ 20 years of prescribed burning remained ecologically distinct from remnant savannas. This suggests that some savannas that have converted to oak woodlands may exist in an alternative, or stable, ecological state even following extended restoration efforts.},

	abstract = {The coexistence of many plant species competing for a few resources is one of the central puzzles of community ecology. One explanation is that different species may be competitively superior in different microhabitats. Many species could then coexist within each piece of a mosaic landscape by what has been termed “mass effects,” because subpopulations in areas with negative growth rates would be supplemented by propagules from areas with reproductive surpluses. If mass effects are important, plant species diversity should increase near habitat boundaries, especially where habitat differences are moderate. In the first experimental test of this prediction, plants were censused on 54 transects within the long-established Rothamsted Park Grass plots. Very few showed significant declines in species richness with distance from subplot boundaries. Nonetheless, the regression coefficients were negative much more often than expected by chance, suggesting that weak mass effects operated. The effect was strongest where neighboring subplots differed greatly, with no evidence of the predicted decline where differences were extreme. Detailed analyses of transects with apparent mass effects revealed few species that behaved as predicted. This study serves both to provide evidence of the existence of mass effects and to question their importance in the maintenance of local plant diversity in this system.},

	abstract = {Comparison of mitochondrial and morphological divergence in eight populations of a widespread leaf-litter skink is used to determine the relative importance of geographic isolation and natural selection in generating phenotypic diversity in the Wet Tropics Rainforest region of Australia. The populations occur in two geographically isolated regions, and within each region, in two different habitats (closed rainforest and tall open forest) that span a well characterized ecological gradient. Morphological differences among ancient geographic isolates (separated for several million years, judging by their mitochondrial DNA sequence divergence) were slight, but morphological and life history differences among habitats were large and occurred despite moderate to high levels of mitochondrial gene flow. A field experiment identified avian predation as one potential agent of natural selection. These results indicate that natural selection operating across ecological gradients can be more important than geographic isolation in similar habitats in generating phenotypic diversity. In addition, our results indicate that selection is sufficiently strong to overcome the homogenizing effects of gene flow, a necessary first step toward speciation in continuously distributed populations. Because ecological gradients may be a source of evolutionary novelty, and perhaps new species, their conservation warrants greater attention. This is particularly true in tropical regions, where most reserves do not include ecological gradients and transitional habitats.},

	abstract = {Areas of environmental transition, where ecological communities coincide, are sometimes termed ecotones. These regions often correspond with sharp environmental gradients. Ecotones occur at multiple spatial scales, ranging from transitions between biomes to local small-scale transitions. In recent years ecotones have received increasing scientific attention after being neglected for years, as studies historically often focused on distinct communities. However, it is still debatable whether these transitional regions are speciation and biodiversity hotspots that deserve special conservation interest or are actually areas that hold marginal populations that depend on other parts of the range for the maintenance of their biodiversity and therefore should not deserve primary investment. This paper discusses some of the recent advancements in our understanding of the role of ecotones in ecology, evolution, and conservation.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Four contrasting ecotones were sampled to address three questions: (1) Are there ‘ecotonal’ species, (2) Do ecotones possess higher (or lower) species richness than the adjacent communities? and (3) Are exotic species more likely to occur in ecotones? One ecotone was edaphic, one was apparently caused by a positive-feedback switch, one was environmental/anthropogenic and one was entirely anthropogenic. The exact position of each ecotone was established from the spatial change in ordination scores. Ecotonal species, in the sense of species mainly restricted to the ecotone at the site, were present in all four ecotones. All but one of the ecotonal species were native. The switch ecotone and the purely anthropogenic ecotone also contained native species that were significantly more frequent in the ecotone than in either adjacent community. Species richness was intermediate between that of the two adjacent communities in three of the ecotones. In the environmental/anthropogenic ecotone, species richness was higher than in adjacent communities, but not significantly so. There were appreciable numbers of exotic species in the two ecotones with anthropogenic influence, one of which had a proportion of exotic species intermediate between the two adjacent communities. Contrary to theory, the proportion of exotic species in the second ecotone was significantly lower than in either adjacent community. We conclude that all three features we examined depend on the particular ecological conditions and the ecology of the species present; they are not intrinsic properties of ecotones.},

	abstract = {Questions Two alternative mechanisms of abrupt vegetation change across ecological boundaries have been proposed: (1) concomitantly abrupt gradients in physical environmental variables and vegetation across the boundary, and (2) gradual environmental gradients that vegetation responds to in a non-linear or threshold manner. Here, we evaluate spatial patterns of climate and vegetation across a grassland–forest biome boundary to examine evidence in favour of either of these alternatives. Location Minnesota, USA. Methods Vegetation data represented the presence of prairie vs. forest vegetation in Minnesota from 1847 to 1908, generally prior to European settlement of the region, while the climatic variables represented an index of long-term average moisture availability (precipitation minus potential evapotranspiration (P – PET). Using linear and sigmoidal regression models, we evaluated spatial patterns of change in vegetation, climate and vegetation–climate relationships across 22 transects (170–400 km) oriented perpendicular to the biome boundary. We also evaluated boundary characteristics in light of dominant topographical controls and position along the boundary. Results Vegetation followed a sigmoidal pattern of change across the boundary, with mean boundary width of ca. 100 km. The P – PET increased by ca. 100 mm across the boundary following a comparatively smooth pattern of change. Climate–vegetation relationships were clearly non-linear across the boundary, indicating these variables did not change in a common spatial pattern. Regional topographical controls modified relationships between vegetation and climate along the length of the boundary. Conclusions Our results document strong non-linear relationships between the presence of forest vegetation and its dominant climate control across a grassland–forest biome boundary. An average change of ca. 100 mm in P – PET moving across the boundary is about 40\% of the long-term mean annual range of this variable, suggesting that modest changes to P – PET may potentially cause substantial shifts in the location of the prairie–forest boundary.},

	abstract = {Edge effects have been studied for decades because they are a key component to understanding how landscape structure influences habitat quality. However, making sense of the diverse patterns and extensive variability reported in the literature has been difficult because there has been no unifying conceptual framework to guide research. In this review, we identify four fundamental mechanisms that cause edge responses: ecological flows, access to spatially separated resources, resource mapping, and species interactions. We present a conceptual framework that identifies the pathways through which these four mechanisms can influence distributions, ultimately leading to new ecological communities near habitat edges. Next, we examine a predictive model of edge responses and show how it can explain much of the variation reported in the literature. Using this model, we show that, when observed, edge responses are largely predictable and consistent. When edge responses are variable for the same species at the same edge type, observed responses are rarely in opposite directions. We then show how remaining variability may be understood within our conceptual frameworks. Finally, we suggest that, despite all the research in this area, the development of tools to extrapolate edge responses to landscapes has been slow, restricting our ability to use this information for conservation and management.},

In contrast to past theories of rainforest speciation, which emphasize geographic isolation, these results suggest that natural selection may play an important role in generating rainforest biodiversity.

Effects of sowing were large and significant 8 years after sowing, revealing the role of seed limitation in these grassland communities. 5 In total, the results suggest that dispersal limitations, species pools and local biotic processes interact to regulate plant community structure.},

Based on availability, red-headed woodpeckers selected snags and trees with greater dead limb length. Red-headed woodpeckers nested in areas with greater basal area, cavity density, snag density, limb-tree density, and total dead limb length. Red-headed woodpeckers exhibited a decadent-tree threshold that was most accurately measured by the number of trees with dead limbs around (0.04 ha) nests. We found that the probability of a red-headed woodpecker nest being present greatly increased above the decadent-tree threshold.

	abstract = {Efforts to restore and maintain oak savannas in North America, with emphasis on the use of prescribed fire, have become common. Little is known, however about how restoration affects animal populations, especially those of birds. I compared the breeding densities, community structure, and reproductive success of birds in oak savannas maintained by prescribed fire (12 sites) with those in closed-canopy forests (13 sites). All sampling was conducted in Illinois (U.S.A.). Of the 31 bird species analyzed, 12 were more common in savannas, 14 were not affected by habitat structure, and 5 were more common in forest habitat. The species favored by disturbance and restoration included Northern Bobwhites (Colinus virginianus), Mourning Doves (Zenaida macroura), Red-headed Woodpeckers (Melanerpes erythrocephalus), Indigo Buntings (Passerina cyanea), and Baltimore Orioles (Icterus galbula). Those more common in closed-canopy forest included Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapilla) and Wood Thrushes (Hylocichla mustelina). Few species were unique to one type of habitat, but overall avian community structure in oak savannas and closed-canopy forests was generally distinctive. Estimates of nesting success (derived from 785 nests) revealed that 6 of the 13 species considered experienced greater productivity in the savanna habitat. Rates of brood parasitism were unaffected by restoration and habitat structure. Within savannas, tract size had little effect on breeding abundances and reproductive success. My results illustrate that restoration techniques can significantly affect the ecology of constituent animal populations and communities and have key implications regarding avian conservation and the management of forest habitat in fragmented landscapes. Small patches of forest habitat that regularly function as population sinks may offer far better prospects for birds if they are subjected to disturbance and ecosystem restoration.},

By reducing the abundance of dominant plants and releasing subordinates from competitive exclusion, they can have an outsized impact on plant communities. Most research on the ecological role of hemiparasites is manipulative and focuses on a small number of hemiparasitic taxa. Here, we ask whether patterns in natural plant communities match the expectation that hemiparasites affect the structure of plant communities. Our data were collected on 129 national park units spanning the continental United States. The most common hemiparasite genera were Pedicularis, Castilleja, Krameria, and Comandra. We used null models and linear mixed models to determine whether hemiparasites were associated with changes in community richness and evenness. Hemiparasite presence did not affect community metrics. Hemiparasite abundance was positively associated with increasing evenness of herbaceous species, but not with species richness. The associations that we observed on a continental scale are consistent with evidence that the impacts of root hemiparasitic plants on evenness can be substantial and abundance dependent but that effects on richness are less pronounced. Hemiparasites mediate competitive exclusion in communities to facilitate species coexistence and merit consideration of inclusion in ecological theories of coexistence.},

We estimated densities of 16 species using distance sampling to account for detection probability, and we determined relationships of bird abundance with management and vegetation variables by evaluating support for a priori models. Densities of early-successional and generalist species were positively related, and interior-forest species negatively related, to restoration. Densities of Brown-headed Nuthatch (Sitta pusilla), Eastern Towhee (Pipilo erythrophthalmus), Eastern Wood-Pewee (Contopus virens), Pine Warbler (Setophaga pinus), Prairie Warbler (Setophaga discolor), Red-headed Woodpecker (Melanerpes erythrocephalus), White-eyed Vireo (Vireo griseus), and Yellow-breasted Chat (Icteria virens) were positively related to prescribed fire activity. Blue-winged Warbler (Vermivora cyanoptera), Kentucky Warbler (Geothlypis formosa), and Yellow-breasted Chat densities were positively related to tree thinning. Many species had higher densities in areas with less canopy cover, tree density, and forest cover. Acadian Flycatcher (Empidonax virescens), Black-and-white Warbler (Mniotilta varia), Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla), Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina), and Worm-eating Warbler (Helmitheros vermivorum) were negatively related to one or more aspects of restoration treatment and generally preferred areas with greater tree density and canopy cover. Summer Tanagers (Piranga rubra) were abundant but density was not strongly related to management or vegetation variables. Restoration provided breeding habitat for disturbance-dependent species and woodland generalists, many of which are species of conservation concern, but canopy cover generally remained too great for species that require more open savanna.},

This is the first benthic δ18O stack composed of more than three records to extend beyond 850 ka, and we use its improved signal quality to identify 24 new marine isotope stages in the early Pliocene. We also present a new LR04 age model for the Pliocene-Pleistocene derived from tuning the δ18O stack to a simple ice model based on 21 June insolation at 65°N. Stacked sedimentation rates provide additional age model constraints to prevent overtuning. Despite a conservative tuning strategy, the LR04 benthic stack exhibits significant coherency with insolation in the obliquity band throughout the entire 5.3 Myr and in the precession band for more than half of the record. The LR04 stack contains significantly more variance in benthic δ18O than previously published stacks of the late Pleistocene as the result of higher-resolution records, a better alignment technique, and a greater percentage of records from the Atlantic. Finally, the relative phases of the stack's 41- and 23-kyr components suggest that the precession component of δ18O from 2.7–1.6 Ma is primarily a deep-water temperature signal and that the phase of δ18O precession response changed suddenly at 1.6 Ma.},

	abstract = {Foraminiferal tests are a common component of many marine sediments. The oxygen isotope ratio (δ18O) of test calcite is frequently used to reconstruct aspects of their life environment. The δ18O depends mainly on the isotope ratio of the water it is precipitated from, the temperature of calcification, and, to a lesser extent, the carbonate ion concentration. Foraminifera and other organisms can potentially preserve their original isotope ratio for many millions of years, although diagenetic processes can alter the ratios. Work on oxygen isotope ratios of foraminifera was instrumental in the discovery of the orbital theory of the ice ages and continues to be widely used in the study of rapid climate change. Compilations of deep sea benthic foraminifer oxygen isotopes have revealed the long history of global climate change over the past 100 million years. Planktonic foraminifer oxygen isotopes are used to investigate the history of past sea surface temperatures, revealing the extent of past ‘greenhouse’ warming and global sea surface temperatures.},

	abstract = {This chapter discusses the factors that must be taken into account when interpreting paleoceanographic records derived from measurements of the oxygen and carbon isotopic composition of foraminifera. interpreted with caution and with close consideration of a wide array of factors. The common strategies are to generate records using only one species in order to minimize the variability due to specific biological effects. Furthermore, it is common to select species that have well-known ecological preferences that are fairly predictable across regions with different oceanographic conditions in the modern ocean. Otherwise, it is difficult to interpret records accurately with respect to understanding how isotopic records might be biased by the potential effects of changes in seasonality, nutrient levels, and depth habitat, not to mention interannual variability (with exceptional blooms) and early diagenetic effects. These practices are thought to minimize variability due to biological factors, and the resulting δ18O downcore record can then be interpreted as primarily a reflection of changes in the δ18O of seawater, the temperature of calcification, and possibly ocean carbon chemistry. If the δ13O and δ13CDIC characteristics of watermasses can be reconstructed, then changes in relative flux of each water mass can be quantified using cores in the mixing zone between end-members. However, in most cases, to isolate absolute changes in local oceanographic conditions and to separate the influence of multiple effects, other paleoceanographic proxies in the same core must be analyzed, and to understand the context of a single record, comparisons with records from other regions must be made.},

We use a sea level record as a proxy for ice volume, a benthic foraminiferal Mg/Cabf record as a proxy for temperature, and a benthic foraminiferal δ18Obf record as a proxy for both. This allows us to construct dual estimates of temperature and ice volume variations for the interval 10–60 Ma: extracting temperature from δ18Obf by using sea level as a proxy for ice volume to constrain the δ18Osw component, and extracting seawater δ18Osw (which reflects ice volume) from δ18Obf by using Mg/Cabf to constrain the temperature component. Each of these approaches requires numerous assumptions, but the range of plausible solutions are concordant on timescales {\textgreater}2 Myr and within an uncertainty of ±2°C temperature and ±0.4‰ δ18Osw. The agreement between the two approaches for the last 50 Myr provides empirical justification for the use of δ18Obf, Mg/Cabf, and sea level records as robust climate proxies. Our reconstructions indicate differences between deep ocean cooling and continental ice growth in the late Cenozoic: cooling occurred gradually in the middle–late Eocene and late Miocene–Pliocene while ice growth occurred rapidly in the earliest Oligocene, middle Miocene, and Plio-Pleistocene. These differences are consistent with climate models that imply that temperatures, set by the long-term CO2 equilibrium, should change only gradually on timescales {\textgreater}2 Myr, but growth of continental ice sheets may be rapid in response to climate thresholds due to feedbacks that are not yet fully understood.},

	abstract = {Oxygen isotopic analyses of pelagic Foraminifera from Atlantic, Caribbean, and Pacific deep-sea cores indicate that the temperature of superficial waters in the equatorial Atlantic and Caribbean underwent periodic oscillations during the Pleistocene with an amplitude of about 6° C. The temperature record of the Pacific cores was much affected by local oceanographic conditions. Seven complete temperature cycles are shown by a Caribbean core. By extrapolating rates of sedimentation based on radiocarbon data, an age of about 280,000 years is obtained for the earliest temperature minimum. Correlation with continental events suggests that the earliest temperature minimum corresponds to the first major glaciation. The chronology of Pacific cores proposed by Arrhenius (1952) must be modified if correspondence with the chronology of Atlantic and Caribbean cores is desired. In one Pacific core which extends to the Pliocene, the 610-cm. level below top is believed to represent the Plio-Pleistocene boundary. About fifteen complete temperature cycles occur above this level, and the length of Pleistocene time is estimated at about 600,000 years. The so-called pre-Günzian stages appear to span a time interval about as long as the Giinz and post-Giinzian stages. A glacial lowering of sea-level of about 100 m. is indicated. Closely spaced samples from short pilot cores furnish a detailed temperature record for postglacial times. A continuous temperature increase from about 16,500 to about 6,000 years ago is indicated, followed by a small temperature decrease. The temperature maximum at about 6,000 years ago is correlated with the "Climatic Optimum." Isotopic analyses of calcareous benthonic Foraminifera show that the temperature of bottom water in the equatorial Pacific during glacial ages was similar to the present, but in the eastern equatorial Atlantic it was about 2.1° C. lower. This difference resulted from the large amount of marine ice present in the North Atlantic. Interglacial bottom temperature in the equatorial Pacific was not more than about 0.8° C. higher than glacial temperatures; interglacial data for the equatorial Atlantic are inconclusive with respect to temperature but indicate an influx of ice meltwater along the bottom larger than at present. Correspondence in time between temperature variations in the low latitudes, as shown by the cores, and glacial events in the high northern latitudes indicates close correspondence between glacial or interglacial phases and wet or dry phases, respectively. Good correlation exists between times of temperature minima as indicated by extrapolated rates of sedimentation and times of insolation minima in high northern latitudes. Control of world climate during the Pleistocene by insolation in the high northern latitudes is indicated. A retardation of about 5,000 years occurred between temperature and insolation cycles. Complete revision of current correlations between the insolation curve and continental events is necessary. The glacial epoch and its ages may be explained by a theory combining topographical and insolation effects. Conditions may be suitable for the beginning of a new ice age in about 10,000 years.},

While smaller glaciations may have been largely or entirely patterned by the astronomical cause or causes, terrestrial factors had an important effect in determining the course of the larger glaciations.

We observe maximum ‘natural’ (pre-anthropogenic forcing) sea-level rise rates below 2 m per century following periods with up to twice present-day ice volumes, and substantially higher rise rates for greater ice volumes. We also find that maximum sea-level rise rates were attained within 2 kyr of the onset of deglaciations, for 85\% of such events. Finally, multivariate regressions of orbital parameters, sea-level and monsoon records suggest that major meltwater pulses account for millennial-scale variability and insolation-lagged responses in Asian monsoon records.},

This article summarizes how the theory has evolved since the pioneer studies of James Croll and Milutin Milankovitch, reviews recent evidence that supports the theory, and argues that a major opportunity is at hand to investigate the physical mechanisms by which the climate system responds to orbital forcing. After a survey of the kinds of models that have been applied to this problem, a strategy is suggested for building simple, physically motivated models, and a time-dependent model is developed that simulates the history of planetary glaciation for the past 500,000 years. Ignoring anthropogenic and other possible sources of variation acting at frequencies higher than one cycle per 19,000 years, this model predicts that the long-term cooling trend which began some 6000 years ago will continue for the next 23,000 years.},

Cycles with periods near 23,000, 41,000, and 100,000 years dominate this climatic narrative. When the narrative is examined in a geographic array of time series, the phase of each climatic oscillation is seen to progress through the system in essentially the same geographic sequence in all three cycles. We argue that the 23,000- and 41,000-year cycles of glaciation are continuous, linear responses to orbitally driven changes in the Arctic radiation budget; and we use the phase progression in each climatic cycle to identify the main pathways along which the initial, local responses to radiation are propagated by the atmosphere and ocean. Early in this progression, deep waters of the Southern Ocean appear to act as a carbon trap. To stimulate new observations and modeling efforts, we offer a process model that gives a synoptic view of climate at the four end-member states needed to describe the system's evolution, and we propose a dynamic system model that explains the phase progression along causal pathways by specifying inertial constants in a chain of four subsystems. “Solutions to problems involving systems of such complexity are not born full grown like Athena from the head of Zeus. Rather they evolve slowly, in stages, each of which requires a pause to examine data at great lengths in order to guarantee a sure footing and to properly choose the next step.” —Victor P. Starr},

	abstract = {Nearly all of Canada was covered by the Wisconsin glaciation and most of the country was deglaciated during the time from about 12,000 to 7,000 years ago. The biota generally survived the glaciation south of the ice sheets in North America, in addition to survival in probable refugia along the coasts and in Yukon and the Arctic Islands.The ice sheets (Laurentide and Cordilleran) completely disturbed the vegetation in Canada. As deglaciation occurred in response to a significant change in climate at the end of the Pleistocene (about 10,000 years ago), recolonization of Canada by vegetation proceeded from the refugia and a northward migration of biota from the southern peripheral region of glaciation. The late glacial episode differed from any subsequent Holocene time episode in terms of the availability of large areas of “raw” soils, the very large volume of meltwater runoff, and the presence of numerous large glacial lakes that at least locally affected the climate.The main sources of information about late Wisconsin and Holocene vegetation are records of plant macrofossils and fossil pollen and spore assemblages preserved in lake sediments, peat bogs, and alluvial deposits.Genetic mixing occurred during recolonization when the populations from different refugia met after having been isolated for several thousand years.The studies of the fossil record are seriously hindered by the lack of basic palynological data (pollen deposition and dispersal in relation to the modern vegetation) and the ecology, phytogeography, and genetics of Canadian vegetation and flora, as well as the relationships between vegetation and climate in particular.It has been demonstrated clearly that the palynological and paleobotanical studies can provide the necessary information required for construction of paleoclimatological models that can be beneficially used in the study of environmental changes.},

	abstract = {This paper integrates recent efforts to map the distribution of biomes for the late Quaternary with the detailed evidence that plant species have responded individualistically to climate change at millennial timescales. Using a fossil-pollen data set of over 700 sites, we review late-Quaternary vegetation history in northern and eastern North America across levels of ecological organization from individual taxa to biomes, and apply the insights gained from this review to critically examine the biome maps generated from the pollen data. Higher-order features of the vegetation (e.g., plant associations, physiognomy) emerge from individualistic responses of plant taxa to climate change, and different representations of vegetation history reveal different aspects of vegetation dynamics. Vegetation distribution and composition were relatively stable during full-glacial times (21 000– 17 000 yr BP) [calendar years] and during the mid- to late Holocene (7000–500 yr BP), but changed rapidly during the late-glacial period and early Holocene (16 000–8 000 yr BP) and after 500 yr BP. Shifts in plant taxon distributions were characterized by individualistic changes in population abundances and ranges and included large east–west shifts in distribution in addition to the northward redistribution of most taxa. Modern associations such as Fagus–Tsuga and Picea–Alnus–Betula date to the early Holocene, whereas other associations common to the late-glacial period (e.g., Picea–Cyperaceae–Fraxinus–Ostrya/ Carpinus) no longer exist. Biomes are dynamic entities that have changed in distribution, composition, and structure over time. The late-Pleistocene suite of biomes is distinct from those that grew during the Holocene. The pollen-based biome reconstructions are able to capture the major features of late-Quaternary vegetation but downplay the magnitude and variety of vegetational responses to climate change by (1) limiting apparent land-cover change to ecotones, (2) masking internal variations in biome composition, and (3) obscuring the range shifts and changes in abundance among individual taxa. The compositional and structural differences between full-glacial and recent biomes of the same type are similar to or greater than the spatial heterogeneity in the composition and structure of present-day biomes. This spatial and temporal heterogeneity allows biome maps to accommodate individualistic behavior among species but masks climatically important variations in taxonomic composition as well as structural differences between modern biomes and their ancient counterparts.},

	abstract = {The spread of C4 grasses in the late Neogene is one of the most important ecological transitions of the Cenozoic, but the primary driver of this global expansion is widely debated. We use the stable carbon isotopic composition (δ13C) of bison and mammoth tissues as a proxy for the relative abundance of C3 and C4 vegetation in their grazing habitat to determine climatic and atmospheric CO2 controls on C4 grass distributions from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to the present. We predict the spatial variability of grass δ13C in North America using a mean of three different methods of classification and regression tree (CART) machine learning techniques and nine climatic variables. We show that growing season precipitation and temperature are the strongest predictors of all single climate variables. We apply this CART analysis to high-resolution gridded climate data and Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) mean paleoclimate model outputs to produce predictive isotope landscape models (“isoscapes”) for the current, mid-Holocene, and LGM average δ13C of grass-dominated areas across North America. From the LGM to the present, C4 grass abundances substantially increased in the Great Plains despite concurrent increases in atmospheric CO2. These results suggest that changes in growing season precipitation rather than atmospheric CO2 were critically important in the Neogene expansion of C4 grasses.},

Four cores in north, south, and central Greenland show differences at decadal and shorter timescales; it is not yet clear if this represents significant spatial differences in response. The results show clear evidence for colder temperatures and a decrease in snow-accumulation rate. However, the changes in chemical concentrations for the ions looked at here are small, suggesting only minor changes in atmospheric circulation for this event.

	abstract = {Between 2.5 to 1.8 million years ago changes in arctic climate and in meadow mouse dispersal routes correlate with part of the history of uplift and glacial erosion of the Chugach and Saint Elias mountains in Alaska and adjacent Canada. Earlier meadow mice dispersing from Asia to central North America followed a southward coastal route between these mountains and the Pacific Ocean, appearing first in the United States Pacific Northwest. Two and a half million years ago, accelerated uplift of the Chugach and Saint Elias mountains milked Pacific westerly winds, enlarging the ice fields in these mountains so that they then flowed to the sea. This blocked the coastal dispersal for 600,000 years, when no new immigrant meadow mice appeared in the conterminous United States. The uplift also restrained westerly winds that crossed Canada, permitting moister air from the subtropical Atlantic and from an unfrozen Arctic Ocean to produce significant continental glaciation, centered in eastern Canada. By 2.0 million years ago, glacial erosion had lowered these mountains again, letting relatively dry Pacific westerlies extend across Canada, reducing the encroachment of moist Atlantic and arctic air, and ending continental glaciation to the east. The simultaneous reduction of glacial activity in the cordillera allowed meadow mice to renew southward dispersal. Additionally, the lowered mountains remained a rain shadow, causing grassland in the Great Plains of Canada. Thus a new dispersal route to the United States was opened for grazing meadow mice and for the first time their earliest records were in the Great Plains. Loss of the continental ice sheet and an unfrozen Arctic Ocean facilitated the northward spread of warm and moist air from the North Atlantic subtropical high; it flowed northward up the eastern front of the Rocky Mountains in the United States and, mingling with the dry westerlies, northeastward across Canada to northernmost Greenland, where trees then grew. About 1.8 million years ago the Great Plains of the United States were subtropical savannah and remained so until the beginning of the Ice Age 850,000 years ago.},

The system is heavily influenced by historical events, such as the mid-Holocene decline of hemlock. Forest composition is likely to be similar, in the broadest terms, from one interglacial to another, but always to vary in detail. The interaction of individuals, populations and environmental variables ensures that, although deterministic, prediction of change will always be difficult.},

Climate data and vegetation characteristics were assigned to every site. Automated and manual procedures were used to verify the accuracy of geographic coordinates and identify duplicate records among datasets, incomplete pollen sums, and other potential errors. Data are currently available for almost all of North America, with variable density. Pollen taxonomic diversity, as measured by the Shannon–Weiner coefficient, varies as a function of location, as some vegetation regions are dominated by one or two major pollen producers, while other regions have a more even composition of pollen taxa. Squared-chord distances computed between samples show that most modern pollen samples find analogues within their own vegetation zone. Both temperature and precipitation inferred from best analogues are highly correlated with observed values but temperature exhibits the strongest relation. Maps of the contemporary distribution of several pollen types in relation to the range of the plant taxon illustrate the correspondence between plant and pollen ranges.},

	abstract = {Wildfires are ecosystem-level drivers of structure and function in many vegetated biomes. While numerous studies have emphasized the benefits of fire to ecosystems, large wildfires have also been associated with the loss of ecosystem services and shifts in vegetation abundance. The size and number of wildfires are increasing across a number of regions, and yet the outcomes of large wildfire on vegetation at large-scales are still largely unknown. We introduce an exhaustive analysis of wildfire-scale vegetation response to large wildfires across North America's grassland biome. We use 18 years of a newly released vegetation data set combined with 1,390 geospatial wildfire perimeters and drought data to detect large-scale vegetation response among multiple vegetation functional groups. We found no evidence of persistent declines in vegetation driven by wildfire at the biome level. All vegetation functional groups exhibited relatively rapid recovery to pre wildfire ranges of variation across the Great Plains ecoregions, with the exception being a persistent decrease in the abundance of trees in the Northwestern Great Plains. Drought intensity magnified immediate vegetation response to wildfire. Persistent declines in vegetation cover were observed at the scale of single pixels (30 m), suggesting that these responses were localized and represent extreme cases within larger wildfires. Our findings echo over a century of research demonstrating a biome resilient to wildfire.},

Here we use ancient DNA, species distribution models and the human fossil record to elucidate how climate and humans shaped the demographic history of woolly rhinoceros, woolly mammoth, wild horse, reindeer, bison and musk ox. We show that climate has been a major driver of population change over the past 50,000 years. However, each species responds differently to the effects of climatic shifts, habitat redistribution and human encroachment. Although climate change alone can explain the extinction of some species, such as Eurasian musk ox and woolly rhinoceros, a combination of climatic and anthropogenic effects appears to be responsible for the extinction of others, including Eurasian steppe bison and wild horse. We find no genetic signature or any distinctive range dynamics distinguishing extinct from surviving species, emphasizing the challenges associated with predicting future responses of extant mammals to climate and human-mediated habitat change.},

	abstract = {The cell membrane Na,K-ATPase is a member of the P-type family of active cation transport proteins. Recently the molecular structure of the related sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase in an E1 conformation has been determined at 2.6 Å resolution. Furthermore, theoretical models of the Ca-ATPase in E2 conformations are available. As a result of these developments, these structural data have allowed construction of homology models that address the central questions of mechanism of active cation transport by all P-type cation pumps. This review relates recent evidence on functional sites of Na,K-ATPase for the substrate (ATP), the essential cofactor (Mg2+ ions), and the transported cations (Na+ and K+) to the molecular structure. The essential elements of the Ca-ATPase structure, including 10 transmembrane helices and well-defined N, P, and A cytoplasmic domains, are common to all PII-type pumps such as Na,K-ATPase and H,K-ATPases. However, for Na,K-ATPase and H,K-ATPase, which consist of both α- and β-subunits, there may be some detailed differences in regions of subunit interactions. Mutagenesis, proteolytic cleavage, and transition metal-catalyzed oxidative cleavages are providing much evidence about residues involved in binding of Na+, K+, ATP, and Mg2+ ions and changes accompanying E1-E2 or E1-P-E2-P conformational transitions. We discuss this evidence in relation to N, P, and A cytoplasmic domain interactions, and long-range interactions between the active site and the Na+ and K+ sites in the transmembrane segments, for the different steps of the catalytic cycle.},

	abstract = {All cells contain much more potassium, phosphate, and transition metals than modern (or reconstructed primeval) oceans, lakes, or rivers. Cells maintain ion gradients by using sophisticated, energy-dependent membrane enzymes (membrane pumps) that are embedded in elaborate ion-tight membranes. The first cells could possess neither ion-tight membranes nor membrane pumps, so the concentrations of small inorganic molecules and ions within protocells and in their environment would equilibrate. Hence, the ion composition of modern cells might reflect the inorganic ion composition of the habitats of protocells. We attempted to reconstruct the "hatcheries" of the first cells by combining geochemical analysis with phylogenomic scrutiny of the inorganic ion requirements of universal components of modern cells. These ubiquitous, and by inference primordial, proteins and functional systems show affinity to and functional requirement for K(+), Zn(2+), Mn(2+), and phosphate. Thus, protocells must have evolved in habitats with a high K(+)/Na(+) ratio and relatively high concentrations of Zn, Mn, and phosphorous compounds. Geochemical reconstruction shows that the ionic composition conducive to the origin of cells could not have existed in marine settings but is compatible with emissions of vapor-dominated zones of inland geothermal systems. Under the anoxic, CO(2)-dominated primordial atmosphere, the chemistry of basins at geothermal fields would resemble the internal milieu of modern cells. The precellular stages of evolution might have transpired in shallow ponds of condensed and cooled geothermal vapor that were lined with porous silicate minerals mixed with metal sulfides and enriched in K(+), Zn(2+), and phosphorous compounds.},

	abstract = {During the last two decades, the common school of thought has split into two, so that the problem of the origin of life is tackled in the framework of either the 'replication first' paradigm or the 'metabolism first' scenario. The first paradigm suggests that the life started from the spontaneous emergence of the first, supposedly RNA-based 'replicators' and considers in much detail their further evolution in the so-called 'RNA world'. The alternative hypothesis of 'metabolism first' derives the life from increasingly complex autocatalytic chemical cycles. In this work, we emphasize the role of selection during the pre-biological stages of evolution and focus on the constraints that are imposed by physical, chemical, and biological laws. We try to demonstrate that the 'replication first' and 'metabolism first' hypotheses complement, rather than contradict, each other. We suggest that life on Earth has started from a 'metabolism-driven replication'; the suggested scenario might serve as a consensus scheme in the framework of which the molecular details of origin of life can be further elaborated. The key feature of the scenario is the participation of the UV irradiation both as driving and selecting forces during the earlier stages of evolution.},

Several of the residues forming the cavity for rubidium/potassium occlusion in the Na+,K+-ATPase are homologous to those binding calcium in the Ca2+-ATPase of sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum. The β- and γ-subunits specific to the Na+,K+-ATPase are associated with transmembrane helices αM7/αM10 and αM9, respectively. The γ-subunit corresponds to a fragment of the V-type ATPase c subunit.

	abstract = {The initiation and propagation of action potentials (APs) places high demands on the energetic resources of neural tissue. Each AP forces ATP-driven ion pumps to work harder to restore the ionic concentration gradients, thus consuming more energy. Here, we ask whether the ionic currents underlying the AP can be predicted theoretically from the principle of minimum energy consumption. A long-held supposition that APs are energetically wasteful, based on theoretical analysis of the squid giant axon AP, has recently been overturned by studies that measured the currents contributing to the AP in several mammalian neurons. In the single compartment models studied here, AP energy consumption varies greatly among vertebrate and invertebrate neurons, with several mammalian neuron models using close to the capacitive minimum of energy needed. Strikingly, energy consumption can increase by more than ten-fold simply by changing the overlap of the Na+ and K+ currents during the AP without changing the APs shape. As a consequence, the height and width of the AP are poor predictors of energy consumption. In the Hodgkin–Huxley model of the squid axon, optimizing the kinetics or number of Na+ and K+ channels can whittle down the number of ATP molecules needed for each AP by a factor of four. In contrast to the squid AP, the temporal profile of the currents underlying APs of some mammalian neurons are nearly perfectly matched to the optimized properties of ionic conductances so as to minimize the ATP cost., Neurons produce a myriad of action potentials with different shapes and varying heights and widths; underlying these action potentials are highly nonlinear, voltage-dependent ionic conductances with varying biophysical properties. Each action potential comes at a cost: the brain uses a substantial portion of its total energy budget to generate and propagate action potentials. Recent results show that some mammalian action potentials have biophysical properties that make them energy efficient. Yet, how widespread are energy efficient action potentials? Using mathematical analysis and modeling, we show that there is no direct relationship between the height, width, and the energy consumption of a single action potential. Furthermore, we establish that many mammalian action potentials have biophysical properties that reduce the overlap between their inward and outward currents so as to minimize energy consumption. This reduction in overlap results from a combination of ion channel properties uniquely tailored for each particular neuron type and the functional purpose of the action potential in that neuron. By comparing the measured biophysical parameters to the parameters produced by numerical optimization for maximal energy-efficiency, we argue that natural selection for energy-efficiency could help explain both the shape of the action potential and the underlying biophysics of ionic currents.},

	abstract = {Energy use limits the information processing power of the brain. However, apart from the ATP used to power electrical signalling, a significant fraction of the brain's energy consumption is not directly related to information processing. The brain spends just under half of its energy on non-signalling processes, but it remains poorly understood which tasks are so energetically costly for the brain. We review existing experimental data on subcellular processes that may contribute to this non-signalling energy use, and provide modelling estimates, to try to assess the magnitude of their ATP consumption and consider how their changes in pathology may compromise neuronal function. As a main result, surprisingly little consensus exists on the energetic cost of actin treadmilling, with estimates ranging from {\textless} 1\% of the brain's global energy budget up to one-half of neuronal energy use. Microtubule treadmilling and protein synthesis have been estimated to account for very small fractions of the brain's energy budget, whereas there is stronger evidence that lipid synthesis and mitochondrial proton leak are energetically expensive. Substantial further research is necessary to close these gaps in knowledge about the brain's energy-expensive non-signalling tasks.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The steady state kinetics of sodium and potassium ion transport adenosine triphosphatase (EC 3.6.1.3) suggests an activating action of adenosine triphosphate in addition to its action as a phosphate donor. This action might be an acceleration of dissociation of K$^{\textrm{+}}$ or its congeners from the enzyme. To test this possibility transient kinetics of the phosphoenzyme was investigated. In membranes from guinea pig kidney the enzyme was phosphorylated in the presence of magnesium ion and sodium ion with adenosine triphosphate which was radioactive in the terminal phosphate group. To this phosphoenzyme were added congeners of potassium ion, namely, rubidium ion or lithium ion at concentrations which produced an equal acceleration of dephosphorylation. At these same concentrations in the steady state, the level of dephosphoenzyme was higher in the presence of rubidium ion than in the presence of lithium ion. Rephosphorylation was relatively inhibited in the presence of rubidium ion. Rubidium ion appeared to combine with the phosphoenzyme, split off the phosphate group, and remain with the dephosphoenzyme in a relatively stable complex. This complex was isolated kinetically by addition of a high concentration of sodium ion with oligomycin. The isolated complex was less stable following an increase in the concentration of adenosine triphosphate. It was concluded that adenosine triphosphate was activating the enzyme in a fashion functionally distinct from its action as a phosphate donor, since adenosine triphosphate does not phosphorylate the enzyme in the presence of rubidium ion without sodium ion and since the concentration of adenosine triphosphate required for activation was much higher than that required for phosphorylation. The relatively stable complex of rubidium ion with the dephosphoenzyme was interpreted as evidence for a closed or occluded conformation of the active site for translocation of potassium ion across the membrane. Toxic agents altered this complex of the dephosphoenzyme; phlorizin increased and tetraphenyl boron decreased its stability. This kinetic mechanism provides an interpretation for a paradoxical feature in the \textit{p}-nitrophenyl phosphatase activity of this enzyme system.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Developing new experimental techniques allowed the determination of different flux modes, the analysis of the kinetics of enzyme phosphorylation and dephosphorylation as well as of the transport of Na+ and K+ ions across the membrane. The accumulation of results from transport studies allowed the proposal of the gated channel concept that turned out to be a successful approach to explain the transport-related experimental findings.

	abstract = {The sodium pump (Na+, K+-ATPase, NKA) is vital for animal cells, as it actively maintains Na+ and K+ electrochemical gradients across the cell membrane. It is a target of cardiotonic steroids (CTSs) such as ouabain and digoxin. As CTSs are almost unique strong inhibitors specific to NKA, a wide range of derivatives has been developed for potential therapeutic use. Several crystal structures have been published for NKA-CTS complexes, but they fail to explain the largely different inhibitory properties of the various CTSs. For instance, although CTSs are thought to inhibit ATPase activity by binding to NKA in the E2P state, we do not know if large conformational changes accompany binding, as no crystal structure is available for the E2P state free of CTS. Here, we describe crystal structures of the BeF3- complex of NKA representing the E2P ground state and then eight crystal structures of seven CTSs, including rostafuroxin and istaroxime, two new members under clinical trials, in complex with NKA in the E2P state. The conformations of NKA are virtually identical in all complexes with and without CTSs, showing that CTSs bind to a preformed cavity in NKA. By comparing the inhibitory potency of the CTSs measured under four different conditions, we elucidate how different structural features of the CTSs result in different inhibitory properties. The crystal structures also explain K+-antagonism and suggest a route to isoform specific CTSs.},

They are supported by new options for tagging sequences with spatiotemporal sampling information, an expanded interactive Node Calibrations Editor, and an extended Tree Explorer to display timetrees. Also added is a Bayesian method for estimating neutral evolutionary probabilities of alleles in a species using multispecies sequence alignments and a machine learning method to test for the autocorrelation of evolutionary rates in phylogenies. The computer memory requirements for the maximum likelihood analysis are reduced significantly through reprogramming, and the graphical user interface has been made more responsive and interactive for very big data sets. These enhancements will improve the user experience, quality of results, and the pace of biological discovery.

It involves resampling points from one's own data, with replacement, to create a series of bootstrap samples of the same size as the original data. Each of these is analyzed, and the variation among the resulting estimates taken to indicate the size of the error involved in making estimates from the original data. In the case of phylogenies, it is argued that the proper method of resampling is to keep all of the original species while sampling characters with replacement, under the assumption that the characters have been independently drawn by the systematist and have evolved independently. Majority‐rule consensus trees can be used to construct a phylogeny showing all of the inferred monophyletic groups that occurred in a majority of the bootstrap samples. If a group shows up 95\% of the time or more, the evidence for it is taken to be statistically significant. Existing computer programs can be used to analyze different bootstrap samples by using weights on the characters, the weight of a character being how many times it was drawn in bootstrap sampling. When all characters are perfectly compatible, as envisioned by Hennig, bootstrap sampling becomes unnecessary; the bootstrap method would show significant evidence for a group if it is defined by three or more characters.},

We use genome engineering of Drosophila to investigate constraints on the repeated evolution of unrelated herbivorous insects to toxic cardiac glycosides, which primarily occurs via a small subset of possible functionally-relevant substitutions to Na+,K+-ATPase. Surprisingly, we find that frequently observed adaptive substitutions at two sites, 111 and 122, are lethal when homozygous and adult heterozygotes exhibit dominant neural dysfunction. We identify a phylogenetically correlated substitution, A119S, that partially ameliorates the deleterious effects of substitutions at 111 and 122. Despite contributing little to cardiac glycoside-insensitivity in vitro, A119S, like substitutions at 111 and 122, substantially increases adult survivorship upon cardiac glycoside exposure. Our results demonstrate the importance of epistasis in constraining adaptive paths. Moreover, by revealing distinct effects of substitutions in vitro and in vivo, our results underscore the importance of evaluating the fitness of adaptive substitutions and their interactions in whole organisms.},

	abstract = {Herbivores that feed on toxic plants must overcome plant defenses and occasionally may even benefit from them. The current challenge is to understand how herbivores evolve the necessary physiological adaptations and which changes at the molecular level are involved. In this context we studied the leaf beetles genus Chrysochus (Coleoptera, Chrysomelidae). Two species of this genus, C. auratus and C. cobaltinus, feed on plants that contain toxic cardenolides. These beetles not only avoid poisoning by the toxin but also use it for their own defense against predators. All other Chrysochus species feed on plants that are devoid of cardenolides. The most important active principle of cardenolides is their capacity to bind to and thereby block the ubiquitous Na+/K+-ATPase responsible for maintaining cellular potentials. By analyzing the DNA sequence of the putative ouabain-binding site of the α-subunit of the Na+/K+-ATPase gene of Chrysochus and its close relatives feeding on plants with or without cardenolides, we here trace the evolution of cardenolide insensitivity in this group of beetles. The most interesting difference among the sequences involves the amino acid at position 122. Whereas all species that do not encounter cardenolides have an asparagine in this position, both Chrysochus species that feed on cardenolide plants have a histidine instead. This single amino acid substitution has already been shown to confer cardenolide insensitivity in the monarch butterfly. A mtDNA-based phylogeny corroborates the hypothesis that the asparagine at position 122 of the α-subunit of the Na+/K+-ATPase gene as observed in Drosophila and other insects is the plesiomorphic condition in this group of leaf beetles. The later host-plant switch to cardenolide-containing plants in the common ancestor of C. auratus and C. cobaltinus coincides with the exchange of the asparagine for a histidine in the ouabain binding site.},

	abstract = {In a highly ouabain-resistant clone from the Madin-Darby canine kidney cell line (Ki {\textgreater} 4 mM), we have previously identified mutations (C113 to Y or C113 to F) in the first transmembrane helix (H1) of the Na,K-ATPase alpha subunit that increase the Ki of a ouabain-sensitive Na,K pump by 1000-fold. Here we report another mutation (Y317 to C) located in the extracellular segment that joins the third and fourth transmembrane domains (H3-H4 ectodomain) of the alpha subunit that also changes ouabain sensitivity of the Na pump. When this mutation (Y317C) was introduced into the Na,K-ATPase alpha 1 subunit of Xenopus laevis, the ouabain inhibition constant increased by a factor of 5, from 130 (wild type) to 800 nM (mutant). However, the expression of double mutants (C113Y + Y317C) in Xenopus oocytes resulted in highly ouabain-resistant Na,K pumps (Ki approximately 7 mM), reproducing the phenotype of the original Madin-Darby canine kidney cell line. When a more conservative change (Y317F) was introduced into the Na,K-ATPase alpha 1 subunit of X. laevis, the ouabain koff increased and expression of double mutants (C113Y + Y317F) resulted in an intermediate ouabain-resistant Na,K pump (Ki approximately 500 microM). We propose that, in addition to the previously identified H1-H2 ectodomain of Na,K-ATPase alpha subunit, the H3-H4 ectodomain also participates in the structure and/or the function of the ouabain binding site. In this respect, the Y317 plays a critical role since the most conservative change Y313 to F is sufficient to significantly affect ouabain binding.},

	abstract = {For highly specialized insect herbivores, plant chemical defenses are often co-opted as cues for oviposition and sequestration. In such interactions, can plants evolve novel defenses, pushing herbivores to trade off benefits of specialization with costs of coping with toxins? We tested how variation in milkweed toxins (cardenolides) impacted monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) growth, sequestration, and oviposition when consuming tropical milkweed (Asclepias curassavica), one of two critical host plants worldwide. The most abundant leaf toxin, highly apolar and thiazolidine ring–containing voruscharin, accounted for 40\% of leaf cardenolides, negatively predicted caterpillar growth, and was not sequestered. Using whole plants and purified voruscharin, we show that monarch caterpillars convert voruscharin to calotropin and calactin in vivo, imposing a burden on growth. As shown by in vitro experiments, this conversion is facilitated by temperature and alkaline pH. We next employed toxin-target site experiments with isolated cardenolides and the monarch’s neural Na+/K+-ATPase, revealing that voruscharin is highly inhibitory compared with several standards and sequestered cardenolides. The monarch’s typical {\textgreater}50-fold enhanced resistance to cardenolides compared with sensitive animals was absent for voruscharin, suggesting highly specific plant defense. Finally, oviposition was greatest on intermediate cardenolide plants, supporting the notion of a trade-off between benefits and costs of sequestration for this highly specialized herbivore. There is apparently ample opportunity for continued coevolution between monarchs and milkweeds, although the diffuse nature of the interaction, due to migration and interaction with multiple milkweeds, may limit the ability of monarchs to counteradapt.},

A series of mutagenized cDNAs was constructed that replaced residues of the rat alpha 2 subunit with the corresponding residues from the rat alpha 1 subunit. These cDNAs were cloned into a mammalian episomal expression vector (EBOpLPP) and expressed in ouabain-sensitive primate cells. Either of two single substitutions introduced into the rat alpha 2 subunit cDNA (Leu-111----Arg or Asn-122----Asp) conferred partial resistance (approximately 10 microM ouabain) upon transformed cells. This resistance was intermediate between the levels conferred by the rat alpha 1 cDNA (approximately 500 microM ouabain) and the rat alpha 2 cDNA (approximately 0.2 microM ouabain). A double substitution of the rat alpha 2 cDNA (Leu-111----Arg and Asn-122----Asp) conferred a resistance level equivalent to that obtained with rat alpha 1. These results demonstrate that the residues responsible for isoform-specific differences in ouabain sensitivity are located at the end of the H1-H2 extracellular domain. The combination of site-directed mutagenesis and episomal expression provides a useful system for the selection and analysis of mutants.},

Bufonidae were distinct from other Hyloidea at 4–6 of 12 sites and, with one exception, had a homologous amino acid sequence. Melanophryniscus stelzneri had a distinct sequence, consistent with other independent evidence for a differentiated toxin. Tests within Bufonidae detected positive selection within the binding region, providing, to our knowledge, the first evidence of this type for positive selection within Amphibia. There was no evidence for positive selection on Bufonidae or M. stelzneri lineages. Sequence change in Leptodactylus ocellatus, a leptodactylid predator of Bufonidae, provides a molecular basis for predator resistance possibly associated with gene duplication.},

Human Na,K-ATPase alpha1 and alpha2 isoforms exhibit a high ouabain affinity but significantly differ in the ouabain association and dissociation rates. To identify the structural determinants that are involved in these differences, we have prepared chimeras between human alpha1 and alpha2 isoforms and alpha2 mutants in which nonconserved amino acids were exchanged with those of the alpha1 isoform, expressed these constructs in Xenopus laevis oocytes, and measured their ouabain binding kinetics. Our results show that replacement of Met119 and Ser124 in the M1-M2 extracellular loop of the alpha2 isoform by the corresponding Thr119 and Gln124 of the alpha1 isoform shifts both the fast ouabain association and dissociation rates of the alpha2 isoform to the slow ouabain binding kinetics of the alpha1 isoform. The amino acids at position 119 and 124 cooperate with the M7-M8 hairpin and are also responsible for the small differences in the ouabain affinity of the ouabain-sensitive alpha1 and alpha2 isoforms. Thus, we have identified new structural determinants in the Na,K-ATPase alpha-subunit that are involved in ouabain binding and probably control, in an alpha isoform-specific way, the access and release of ouabain to and from its binding site.},

However, to which extent these substitutions alter the Na,K-ATPase's kinetic properties and how they interact with different β-subunits is not clear. The cardenolide-adapted milkweed bug Oncopeltus fasciatus possesses three paralogs of the α-subunit (A, B, and C) that differ in number and identity of resistance-conferring substitutions. We introduced these substitutions into the α-subunit of Drosophila melanogaster and combined them with the β-subunits Nrv2.2 and Nrv3. The substitutions Q111T-N122H-F786N-T797A (A-copy mimic) and Q111T-N122H-F786N (B-copy mimic) mediated high insensitivity to ouabain, yet they drastically lowered ATPase activity. Remarkably, the identity of the β-subunit was decisive and all α-subunits were less active when combined with Nrv3 than when combined with Nrv2.2. Both the substitutions and the co-expressed β-subunit strongly affected the enyzme's affinity for Na+ and K+. Na+ affinity was considerably higher for all enzymes expressed with nrv3 while expression with nrv2.2 mostly increased K+ affinity. Our results provide the first evidence that resistance against cardenolides comes at the cost of significantly altered kinetic properties of the Na,K-ATPase. The β-subunit can strongly modulate these properties but cannot fully compensate for the effect of the substitutions.},

Little is known, however, about the specific requirements of the protein surface for glycoside binding. Using chimeras of gastric H$^{\textrm{+}}$,K$^{\textrm{+}}$-ATPase and Na$^{\textrm{+}}$,K$^{\textrm{+}}$-ATPase, we demonstrated previously that the combined presence of transmembrane hairpins M3-M4 and M5-M6 of Na$^{\textrm{+}}$,K$^{\textrm{+}}$-ATPase in a backbone of H$^{\textrm{+}}$,K$^{\textrm{+}}$-ATPase (HN34/56) is both required and sufficient for high affinity ouabain binding. Since replacement of transmembrane hairpin M3-M4 by the N terminus up to transmembrane segment 3 (HNN3/56) resulted in a low affinity ouabain binding, hairpin M5-M6 seems to be essential for ouabain binding. To assess which residues of M5-M6 are required for ouabain action, we divided this transmembrane hairpin in seven parts and individually replaced these parts by the corresponding sequences of H$^{\textrm{+}}$,K$^{\textrm{+}}$-ATPase in chimera HN34/56. Three of these chimeras failed to bind ouabain following expression in \textit{Xenopus laevis} oocytes. Altogether, these three chimeras contained 7 amino acids that were specific for Na$^{\textrm{+}}$,K$^{\textrm{+}}$-ATPase. Individual replacement of these 7 amino acids by the corresponding amino acids in H$^{\textrm{+}}$,K$^{\textrm{+}}$-ATPase revealed a dramatic loss of ouabain binding for F783Y, T797C, and D804E. As a proof of principle, the Na$^{\textrm{+}}$,K$^{\textrm{+}}$-ATPase equivalents of these 3 amino acids were introduced in different combinations in chimera HN34. The presence of all 3 amino acids appeared to be required for ouabain action. Docking of ouabain onto a three-dimensional-model of Na$^{\textrm{+}}$,K$^{\textrm{+}}$-ATPase suggests that Asp$^{\textrm{804}}$, in contrast to Phe$^{\textrm{783}}$ and Thr$^{\textrm{797}}$, does not actually form part of the ouabain-binding pocket. Most likely, the presence of this amino acid is required for adopting of the proper conformation for ouabain binding.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

These residues are located in the N-terminal half of the alpha 1 subunit suggesting that this portion of the molecule may represent the binding site for cardiac glycosides. However, not all extracellular and transmembrane regions have been investigated, including the H5-H6 membrane-spanning region. To determine if this region of the alpha subunit contributes to ouabain sensitivity, amino acids which have the potential to form hydrogen bonds were substituted with alanine, a non-hydrogen-bonding amino acid. cDNAs encoding enzyme containing these individual amino acid replacements were expressed in ouabain-sensitive HeLa cells, and the ability of the altered enzymes to confer ouabain resistance was examined. Nineteen amino acid substitutions were investigated. T797A (Thr 797 to Ala) was the only substitution which conferred ouabain resistance to sensitive HeLa cells. Three additional substitutions at this position (T797V, T797S, and T797D) were generated in order to examine the effects of the replacements of Thr 797 on ouabain inhibition of Na,K-ATPase activity. The T797V substitution conferred ouabain resistance, but T797S and T797D substitutions did not. The ouabain-resistant cell lines expressing the T797A and T797V substitutions exhibited Na,K-ATPase activity that was 60 and 70 times more resistant to ouabain than the endogenous HeLa or sheep enzymes. The absence of a hydroxyl group at amino acid 797 may be responsible for the reduced sensitivity of the enzyme with substitutions at this position.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

The four random mutant libraries used in this study include all of the transmembrane and extracellular regions of the molecule as well as 75\% of the cytoplasmic domains. Through an extensive number of HeLa cell transfections of these libraries and subsequent ouabain selection, 24 ouabain-resistant clones have been identified. All previously described amino acids that confer ouabain resistance were identified, confirming the completeness of this random mutagenesis screen. The amino acid substitutions that confer the greatest ouabain resistance, such as Gln111--{\textgreater}Arg, Asp121--{\textgreater}Gly, Asp121--{\textgreater}Glu, Asn122--{\textgreater}Asp, and Thr797--{\textgreater}Ala were identified more than once in this study. This extensive survey of the extracellular and transmembrane regions of the Na+/K+-ATPase molecule has identified two new regions of the molecule that affect ouabain sensitivity: the H4 and the H10 transmembrane regions. The new substitutions identified in this study are Leu330--{\textgreater}Gln, Ala331--{\textgreater}Gly, Thr338--{\textgreater}Ala, and Thr338--{\textgreater}Asn in the H4 transmembrane domain and Phe982--{\textgreater}Ser in the H10 transmembrane domain. These substitutions confer modest increases in the concentration of cardiac glycoside needed to produce 50\% inhibition of activity (IC50 values), 3.1-7.9-fold difference. The results of this extensive screening of the Na+/K+-ATPase alpha1 subunit to identify amino acids residues that are important in ouabain sensitivity further supports our hypothesis that the H1-H2 and H4-H8 regions represent the major binding sites for the cardiac glycoside class of drugs.},

	abstract = {Cardenolides are a class of plant secondary compounds that inhibit the proper functioning of the Na(+) , K(+) -ATPase enzyme in susceptible animals. Nonetheless, many insect species are able to sequester cardenolides for their own defence. These include butterflies in the subfamily Danainae (Family: Nymphalidae) such as the monarch (Danaus plexippus). Previous studies demonstrated that monarchs harbour an asparagine (N) to histidine (H) substitution (N122H) in the α subunit of Na(+) , K(+) -ATPase (ATPα) that reduces this enzyme's sensitivity to cardenolides. More recently, it has been suggested that at ATPα position 111, monarchs may also harbour a leucine (L)/glutamine (Q) polymorphism. This later amino acid could also contribute to cardenolide insensitivity. However, here we find that incorrect annotation of the initially reported DNA sequence for ATPα has led to several erroneous conclusions. Using a population genetic and phylogenetic analysis of monarchs and their close relatives, we show that an ancient Q111L substitution occurred prior to the radiation of all Danainae, followed by a second substitution at the same site to valine (V), which arose before the diversification of the Danaus genus. In contrast, N122H appears to be a recent substitution specific to monarchs. Surprisingly, examination of a broader insect phylogeny reveals that the same progression of amino acid substitutions (Q111L → L111V + N122H) has also occurred in Chyrsochus beetles (Family: Chrysomelidae, Subfamily: Eumolpinae) that feed on cardenolide-containing host plants. The parallel pattern of amino acid substitution in these two distantly related lineages is consistent with an adaptive role for these substitutions in reducing cardenolide sensitivity and suggests that their temporal order may be limited by epistatic interactions.},

Furthermore, scientists can access not only the divergence time between two species or higher taxa, but also a timetree of a group of species and a timeline that traces a species’ evolution through time. The new timetree and timeline visualizations are integrated with display of events on earth and environmental history over geological time, which will lead to broader and better understanding of the interplay of the change in the biosphere with the diversity of species on Earth.

The method is broadly based on the popular progressive approach to multiple alignment but avoids the most serious pitfalls caused by the greedy nature of this algorithm. With T-Coffee we pre-process a data set of all pair-wise alignments between the sequences. This provides us with a library of alignment information that can be used to guide the progressive alignment. Intermediate alignments are then based not only on the sequences to be aligned next but also on how all of the sequences align with each other. This alignment information can be derived from heterogeneous sources such as a mixture of alignment programs and/or structure superposition. Here, we illustrate the power of the approach by using a combination of local and global pair-wise alignments to generate the library. The resulting alignments are significantly more reliable, as determined by comparison with a set of 141 test cases, than any of the popular alternatives that we tried. The improvement, especially clear with the more difficult test cases, is always visible, regardless of the phylogenetic spread of the sequences in the tests.},

	abstract = {Early evolutionists believed that the genetic basis of adaptation was micromutational.This view was supported by Ronald Fisher's classical mathematical analysis (of 1930) of his 'geometric model' of adaptation.Beginning in the 1980s, studies of quantitative trait loci and microbial experimental evolution revealed that adaptation sometimes involves a modest number of genes, some of which have surprisingly large effects. These experimental findings pose a serious challenge to evolutionary theory.So far, phenotype-based and DNA sequence-based models of adaptation have yielded surprisingly similar results, indicating the possibility of a robust theory of adaptation.Phenotypic models of adaptation show that the genes that cause adaptation should have approximately exponentially distributed effects; that is, involve many genes that have small effect and a few genes that have large effect.DNA sequence models of adaptation indicate that adaptation should involve mutations of relatively large fitness effects and that adaptation is characterized by a pattern of diminishing returns, in which early substitutions have large fitness effects and later ones have smaller effects.Current theories of adaptation adequately explain certain qualitative patterns that characterize genetic data on adaptation; however, it is not yet clear if these theories can explain these data quantitatively.},

We consider differences in MMR efficiency in relation to mismatch recognition, signaling to direct MMR to the nascent strand, mismatch removal, and the timing of MMR.

Mutation rates in microbes with DNA-based chromosomes are close to 1/300 per genome per replication; in this group, therefore, rates per base pair vary inversely and hugely as genome sizes vary from 6 x 10(3) to 4 x 10(7) bases or base pairs. Mutation rates in higher eukaryotes are roughly 0.1-100 per genome per sexual generation but are currently indistinguishable from 1/300 per cell division per effective genome (which excludes the fraction of the genome in which most mutations are neutral).

	abstract = {Predator-prey interactions have long served as models for the investigation of adaptation and fitness in natural environments. Anti-predator defences such as mimicry and camouflage provide some of the best examples of evolution. Predators, in turn, have evolved sensory systems, cognitive abilities and physiological resistance to prey defences. In contrast to prey defences which have been reviewed extensively, the evolution of predator counter-strategies has received less attention. To gain a comprehensive view of how prey defences can influence the evolution of predator counter-strategies, it is essential to investigate how and when selection can operate. In this review we evaluate how predators overcome prey defences during (i) encounter, (ii) detection, (iii) identification, (iv) approach, (v) subjugation, and (vi) consumption. We focus on prey that are protected by cardiotonic steroids (CTS)-defensive compounds that are found in a wide range of taxa, and that have a specific physiological target. In this system, coevolution is well characterized between specialist insect herbivores and their host plants but evidence for coevolution between CTS-defended prey and their predators has received less attention. Using the predation sequence framework, we organize 574 studies reporting predators overcoming CTS defences, integrate these counter-strategies across biological levels of organization, and discuss the costs and benefits of attacking CTS-defended prey. We show that distinct lineages of predators have evolved dissecting behaviour, changes in perception of risk and of taste perception, and target-site insensitivity. We draw attention to biochemical, hormonal and microbiological strategies that have yet to be investigated as predator counter-adaptations to CTS defences. We show that the predation sequence framework will be useful for organizing future studies of chemically mediated systems and coevolution.},

	abstract = {Fifty years ago, Ehrlich and Raven proposed that insect herbivores have driven much of plant speciation, particularly at tropical latitudes. There have been no explicit tests of their hypotheses. Indeed there were no proposed mechanisms either at the time or since by which herbivores might generate new plant species. Here we outline two main classes of mechanisms, prezygotic and postzygotic, with a number of scenarios in each by which herbivore-driven changes in host plant secondary chemistry might lead to new plant lineage production. The former apply mainly to a sympatric model of speciation while the latter apply to a parapatric or allopatric model. Our review suggests that the steps of each mechanism are known to occur individually in many different systems, but no scenario has been thoroughly investigated in any one system. Nevertheless, studies of Dalechampia and its herbivores and pollinators, and patterns of defense tradeoffs in trees on different soil types in the Peruvian Amazon provide evidence consistent with the original hypotheses of Ehrlich and Raven. For herbivores to drive sympatric speciation, our findings suggest that interactions with both their herbivores and their pollinators should be considered. In contrast, herbivores may drive speciation allopatrically without any influence by pollinators. Finally, there is evidence that these mechanisms are more likely to occur at low latitudes and thus more likely to produce new species in the tropics. The mechanisms we outline provide a predictive framework for further study of the general role that herbivores play in diversification of their host plants.},

Tests of parallel evolution of reproductive isolation, trait-based assortative mating, and reproductive isolation by active selection have demonstrated that ecological speciation is a common means by which new species arise. Evidence for mutation-order speciation by natural selection is more limited and has been best documented by instances of reproductive isolation resulting from intragenomic conflict.

The Km for K+ stimulation of Na+K+-ATPase in M. sexta and D. plexippus is 2.2 mM and for Na+ stimulation in D. plexippus, 6.0 mM. In vitro ouabain concentrations of 1.0 × 10−5 M and 5.0 × 10−5 M in the presence of 7.5 mM K+ inhibited Na+K+-ATPase activity in H. cecropia and M. sexta by 50\% respectively. Na+K+-ATPase from D. plexippus was approximately 300 times less sensitive. High concentrations (10−3 M in haemolymph) of ouabain had no effect on M. sexta in vivo. This is largely explained by haemolymph K+ ({\textgreater}; 30 mM) antagonizing the binding of ouabain to Na+K+-ATPase. As demonstrated in vitro, 30 mM K+ totally protects Na+K+-ATPase from inhibition by 7.5 × 10−3 M ouabain in D. plexippus and protects the enzyme by 65\% in M. sexta. At least part of the physiological burden incurred in utilization of cardiac glycoside ingestion and storage for protection from predation, however, is probably related to the toxic effects of cardiac glycosides on neuronal Na+K+-ATPase.},

In Drosophila, the Malpighian (renal) tubule contains large amounts of Na+,K+ ATPase that is known biochemically to be exquisitely sensitive to ouabain, yet the intact tissue is almost unaffected by even extraordinary concentrations. The explanation is that the tubules are protected by an active ouabain transport system, colocated with the Na+,K+ ATPase, thus preventing ouabain from reaching inhibitory concentrations within the basolateral infoldings of principal cells. These data show that the Na+,K+ ATPase, previously thought to be unimportant, may be as vital in insect tissues as in vertebrates, but can be cryptic to conventional pharmacology.},

Two components of ATPases activity are present in the three tissues studied. 3. The physiochemical properties of Na+/K(+)-transporting ATPase from mid-gut, brain and excretory system (hind-gut plus Malpighian tubules) are essentially the same. 4. The calculated values of PI50 were 2 (I50 = 1 x 10(-2) M), 3.7 (I50 = 2 x 10(-4) M) and 6.4 (I50 = 3.98 x 10(-7)) for Na+/K(+)-ATPase from mid-gut, excretory system and brain, respectively. The mid-gut contains the most ouabain-resistant Na+/K(+)-ATPase. 5. The results suggest that P. bufonius have developed some tolerance to toxic cardiac glycosides (CGS), but there is a possibility of autotoxicity as indicated by the presence of ouabain-sensitive ATPase from brain tissue. 6. It was concluded that the dissimilarities of Na+/K(+)-ATPases from different tissues of P. bufonius are probably due to tissue-dependent differences in ouabain sensitivity (or isoenzymes pattern) available in the same insect. 7. The atrophy of female flight muscle of P. bufonius suggests the possibility of physiological cost inflicted on insects consuming poisonous plants.},

Terpenoids are more expensive to manufacture per gram than most other primary and secondary metabolites due to their extensive chemical reduction. The enzyme costs of making terpenoids are also high since terpenoid biosynthetic enzymes are apparently not shared with other metabolic pathways. In fact, plant cells may even possess more than one set of enzymes for catalyzing the basic steps of terpenoid formation. Terpenoids are usually sequestered in complex, multicellular secretory structures, and so storage costs for these substances are also likely to be substantial. However, not all of the processes involved in terpenoid accumulation require large investments of resources. For instance, the maintenance of terpenoid pools is probably inexpensive because there is no evidence that substantial quantities of terpenes are lost as a result of metabolic turnover, volatilization, or leaching. Moreover, plants may reduce their net terpenoid costs by employing individual compounds in more than one role or by catabolizing substances that are no longer needed, although it is still unclear if such practices are widespread. These findings (and other facets of terpenoid biochemistry and physiology) are discussed in relation to the assumptions and predictions of several current theories of plant defense, including the carbonnutrient balance hypothesis, the growth-differentiation balance hypothesis, and the resource availability hypothesis.},

Different plant lineages also synthesize hundreds of distinct terpenoids, with the total number of such specialized plant terpenoids estimated in the scores of thousands. Phylogenetically restricted terpenoids are implicated in defense or in the attraction of beneficial organisms. A popular hypothesis is that the ability of plants to synthesize new compounds arose incrementally by selection when, as a result of gradual changes in their biotic partners and enemies, the ‘old’ plant compounds were no longer effective, a process dubbed the ‘coevolutionary arms race’. Another hypothesis posits that often the sheer diversity of such compounds provides benefits that a single compound cannot. In this article, we review the unique features of the biosynthetic apparatus of terpenes in plants that facilitate the production of large numbers of distinct terpenoids in each species and how facile genetic and biochemical changes can lead to the further diversification of terpenoids. We then discuss evidence relating to the hypotheses that given ecological functions may be enhanced by the presence of mixtures of terpenes and that the acquisition of new functions by terpenoids may favor their retention once the original functions are lost.},

Mechanisms for indirect resistance include the provision of resources (e.g. food and shelter) for predators as well as the provision of information (e.g. herbivore-induce volatiles) on the location of hosts and prey that can facilitate the foraging behaviour of natural enemies of herbivores. 2. These ecologically divergent mechanisms for attracting bodyguards should also differ fundamentally in their evolution, particularly in how herbivores and their predators select on plant resistance traits. However, these different strategies are typically lumped together in theoretical discussions of indirect defences. 3. Here we highlight the fundamental differences between resource-mediated and information-mediated indirect resistance and discuss the relative evolutionary impacts of the interacting organisms as agents of natural selection in shaping indirect defence traits of plants. 4. We review clear evidence for a defensive function of resource-mediated indirect resistance, and recognize a significant lack of evidence for an adaptive function of information-mediated traits. A comparison of the underlying factors driving coevolution in each category of indirect defences, suggests that information-mediated indirect resistance is less likely to be subject to coevolution between plants and the third trophic level.},

Cardiac glycosides represent a group of plant toxins that block the Na,K-ATPase, a vital membrane protein in animals. Several herbivorous insects have convergently evolved resistant Na,K-ATPases, and in some species, convergent gene duplications have also arisen, likely to cope with pleiotropic costs of resistance. To understand the genetic basis and predictability of these adaptations, we studied five independent lineages of leaf-mining flies (Diptera: Agromyzidae). These flies have colonized host plants in four botanical families that convergently evolved cardiac glycosides of two structural types: cardenolides and bufadienolides. We compared each of six fly species feeding on such plants to a phylogenetically related but nonadapted species. Irrespective of the type of cardiac glycoside in the host plant, five out of six exposed species displayed substitutions in the cardiac glycoside-binding site of the Na,K-ATPase that were previously described in other insect orders; in only one species was the gene duplicated. In vitro assays of nervous tissue extractions confirmed that the substitutions lead to increased resistance of the Na,K-ATPase. Our results demonstrate that target site insensitivity of Na,K-ATPase is a common response to dietary cardiac glycosides leading to highly predictable amino acid changes; nonetheless, convergent evolution of gene duplication for this multifunctional enzyme appears more constrained.},

Some phytophagous insects have evolved tolerance to these chemical defenses, and can sequester secondary defense compounds for use against their own predators and parasitoids. While numerous studies have examined plant-insect interactions, little is known about lichen-insect interactions. Our study focused on reconstructing the evolution of lichen phenolic sequestration in the tiger moth tribe Lithosiini (Lepidoptera: Erebidae: Arctiinae), the most diverse lineage of lichen-feeding moths, with 3000 described species. We built an RNA-Seq dataset and examined the adult metabolome for the presence of lichen-derived phenolics. Using the transcriptomic dataset, we recover a well-resolved phylogeny of the Lithosiini, and determine that the metabolomes within species are more similar than those among species. Results from an initial ancestral state reconstruction suggest that the ability to sequester phenolics produced by a single chemical pathway preceded generalist sequestration of phenolics produced by multiple chemical pathways. We conclude that phenolics are consistently and selectively sequestered within Lithosiini. Furthermore, sequestration of compounds from a single chemical pathway may represent a synapomorphy of the tribe, and the ability to sequester phenolics produced by multiple pathways arose later. These findings expand on our understanding of the interactions between Lepidoptera and their lichen hosts.},

We note that two sets of defensive signals (secondary chemicals and ultrasound) have been incorporated independently into arctiid courtship displays. Pyrrolizidine alkaloids are used in larval defence, and transformed into male courtship pheromones in several lineages. Phylogenetic inertia best explains the presence of adult collection and use of PAs in the absence of larval sequestration. Ultrasound, an adult defensive display directed at bats and other predators, has also been incorporated into arctiid mating displays. Sensory exploitation appears to underlie this co-option of defence signals for mating purposes.},

	abstract = {Herbivorous insects have evolved many mechanisms to overcome plant chemical defences, including detoxification and sequestration. Herbivores may also use toxic plants to reduce parasite infection. Plant toxins could directly interfere with parasites or could enhance endogenous immunity. Alternatively, plant toxins could favour down-regulation of endogenous immunity by providing an alternative (exogenous) defence against parasitism. However, studies on genomewide transcriptomic responses to plant defences and the interplay between plant toxicity and parasite infection remain rare. Monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) are specialist herbivores of milkweeds (Asclepias spp.), which contain toxic cardenolides. Monarchs have adapted to cardenolides through multiple resistance mechanisms and can sequester cardenolides to defend against bird predators. In addition, high-cardenolide milkweeds confer monarch resistance to a specialist protozoan parasite (Ophryocystis elektroscirrha). We used this system to study the interplay between the effects of plant toxicity and parasite infection on global gene expression. We compared transcriptional profiles between parasite-infected and uninfected monarch larvae reared on two milkweed species. Our results demonstrate that monarch differentially express several hundred genes when feeding on A. curassavica and A. incarnata, two species that differ substantially in cardenolide concentrations. These differentially expressed genes include genes within multiple families of canonical insect detoxification genes, suggesting that they play a role in monarch toxin resistance and sequestration. Interestingly, we found little transcriptional response to infection. However, parasite growth was reduced in monarchs reared on A. curassavica, and in these monarchs, several immune genes were down-regulated, consistent with the hypothesis that medicinal plants can reduce reliance on endogenous immunity.},

Allelochemicals such as terpenoids, alkaloids, indoles, glucosinolates, flavonoids, coumarins, cardenolides, phenylpropenes, and a ketohydrocarbon were all metabolized by the microsomal cytochrome P-450 monooxygenases in both species. Fall armyworm microsomes oxidized monoterpenes more favorably than other types of terpenes, indicating a preference for these compounds. In all instances, the oxidative metabolism of these allelochemicals can be induced by dietary allelochemicals such as indole 3-carbinol, indole 3-acetonitrile, menthol, flavone, or peppermint oil ranging from 1.3- to 9.5-fold. In the case of certain triterpenes, tetraterpene, alkaloid, coumarin, and cardenolides, metabolic activity can only be observed after induction. The monooxygenase activities toward these allelochemicals were generally higher in the generalist than in the semispecialist.

In response to toxic cardiac glycosides produced by these plants, the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) and other specialist herbivores have evolved parallel substitutions in the alpha subunit (ATPA) of the Na+/K+-ATPase. These substitutions render the pump insensitive to cardiac glycosides2,3, allowing the monarch and other specialists, from aphids to beetles, to sequester cardiac glycosides, which in turn provide defense against attacks by enemies from the third trophic level4. The evolution of ‘target-site-insensitivity’ substitutions in these herbivores poses a fundamental biological question: have predators and parasitoids that feed on cardiac-glycoside-sequestering insects also evolved Na+/K+-ATPases that are similarly insensitive to cardiac glycosides (as predicted by Whiteman and Mooney)5? In other words, can plant toxins cause evolutionary cascades that reach the third trophic level? Here we show that at least four enemies of the monarch and other milkweed herbivores have indeed evolved amino-acid substitutions associated with target-site insensitivity to cardiac glycosides. These attackers represent four major animal clades, implicating cardiac glycosides as keystone molecules6 and establishing ATPalpha, which encodes ATPA, as a keystone gene with effects that reverberate within ecological communities7.},

Specialized insects across six taxonomic orders feeding on cardenolide-containing plants have convergently evolved target site insensitivity via specific amino acid substitutions in the Na/K-ATPase. Nonetheless, in vitro pharmacological experiments have suggested a role for multidrug transporters (Mdrs) and organic anion transporting polypeptides (Oatps), which may provide a basal level of protection in both specialized and non-adapted insects. Because the genes coding for these proteins are evolutionarily conserved and in vivo genetic evidence in support of this hypothesis is lacking, here we used wildtype and mutant Drosophila melanogaster (Drosophila) in capillary feeder (CAFE) assays to quantify toxicity of three chemically diverse, medically relevant cardenolides. We examined multiple components of fitness, including mortality, longevity, and LD50, and found that, while the three cardenolides each stimulated feeding (i.e., no deterrence to the toxin), all decreased lifespan, with the most apolar cardenolide having the lowest LD50 value. Flies showed a clear non-monotonic dose response and experienced high levels of toxicity at the cardenolide concentration found in plants. At this concentration, both Mdr and Oatp knockout mutant flies died more rapidly than wildtype flies, and the mutants also experienced more adverse neurological effects on high-cardenolide-level diets. Our study further establishes Drosophila as a model for the study of cardenolide pharmacology and solidifies support for the hypothesis that multidrug and organic anion transporters are key players in insect protection against dietary cardenolides.},

	abstract = {Evolution of insensitivity to the toxic effects of cardiac glycosides has become a model in the study of convergent evolution, as five taxonomic orders of insects use the same few similar amino acid substitutions in the otherwise highly conserved Na,K-ATPase α. We show here that insensitivity in pyrgomorphid grasshoppers evolved along a slightly divergent path. As in other lineages, duplication of the Na,K-ATPase α gene paved the way for subfunctionalization: one copy maintains the ancestral, sensitive state, while the other copy is resistant. Nonetheless, in contrast with all other investigated insects, the grasshoppers' resistant copy shows length variation by two amino acids in the first extracellular loop, the main part of the cardiac glycoside-binding pocket. RT-qPCR analyses confirmed that this copy is predominantly expressed in tissues exposed to the toxins, while the ancestral copy predominates in the nervous tissue. Functional tests with genetically engineered Drosophila Na,K-ATPases bearing the first extracellular loop of the pyrgomorphid genes showed the derived form to be highly resistant, while the ancestral state is sensitive. Thus, we report convergence in gene duplication and in the gene targets for toxin insensitivity; however, the means to the phenotypic end have been novel in pyrgomorphid grasshoppers.},

	abstract = {An important question in evolutionary genetics concerns the extent to which adaptive convergence in protein function is caused by convergent or parallel changes at the amino acid level. Even when there is a many-to-one mapping of genotype to phenotype, particular mutations may be preferentially fixed (substitution bias) owing to among-site variation in the rate of mutation to function-altering alleles and/or variation among mutations in their probability of fixation once they arise.Within the set of mutations that have functionally equivalent effects on a selected phenotype, those that incur a lower magnitude of deleterious pleiotropy will generally have higher fixation probabilities. Mutational pleiotropy may therefore represent an important source of substitution bias.A key finding is that the fitness effects of amino acid mutations are often conditional on the genetic background in which they occur. This context dependence (epistasis) reduces the probability of molecular convergence and parallelism because it reduces the number of possible mutations that have unconditionally acceptable effects in divergent genetic backgrounds.Context-dependent mutational effects often stem from pleiotropic trade-offs, as evidenced by cases where the fitness impact of a given mutation is determined by compensatory (conditionally beneficial) mutations at other sites in the same protein.Even if mutations have identical functional effects on a selected phenotype, they can have different fitness effects owing to a nonlinear mapping of phenotype to fitness. Thus, probabilities of convergence and parallelism are reduced by species differences in the genotype-phenotype map and by differences in the phenotype-fitness map.Although computational analyses of sequence variation play a key part in suggesting hypotheses about the causes of convergent and parallel substitutions and their possible adaptive significance, experimental analyses of specific mutations are necessary to test such hypotheses.},

Convergent evolution can be used as a guide to identify candidate mutations that underlie adaptive traits2–4, and new genome editing technology is facilitating functional validation of these mutations in whole organisms1,5. We combined these approaches to study a classic case of convergence in insects from six orders, including the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus), that have independently evolved to colonize plants that produce cardiac glycoside toxins6–11. Many of these insects evolved parallel amino acid substitutions in the α-subunit (ATPα) of the sodium pump (Na+/K+-ATPase)7–11, the physiological target of cardiac glycosides12. Here we describe mutational paths involving three repeatedly changing amino acid sites (111, 119 and 122) in ATPα that are associated with cardiac glycoside specialization13,14. We then performed CRISPR–Cas9 base editing on the native Atpα gene in Drosophila melanogaster flies and retraced the mutational path taken across the monarch lineage11,15. We show in vivo, in vitro and in silico that the path conferred resistance and target-site insensitivity to cardiac glycosides16, culminating in triple mutant ‘monarch flies’ that were as insensitive to cardiac glycosides as monarch butterflies. ‘Monarch flies’ retained small amounts of cardiac glycosides through metamorphosis, a trait that has been optimized in monarch butterflies to deter predators17–19. The order in which the substitutions evolved was explained by amelioration of antagonistic pleiotropy through epistasis13,14,20–22. Our study illuminates how the monarch butterfly evolved resistance to a class of plant toxins, eventually becoming unpalatable, and changing the nature of species interactions within ecological communities2,6–11,15,17–19.},

Although there has been much discussion, no quantitative framework currently exists to test for these biases. Here, we describe a method for distinguishing between the two processes that likely account for biased rates of substitution: variation in mutation rates and variation in the probability that a mutation becomes fixed once it arises. We then use this approach to examine the type and magnitude of these biases during evolutionary transitions across multiple scales: those involving repeated origins of individual traits (flower color change), and transitions involving broad suites of traits (morphological and physiological trait evolution in plants and animals). We show that fixation biases can be strong at both levels of comparison, likely due to differences in the magnitude of deleterious pleiotropy associated with alternative mutation categories. However, we also show that the scale at which these comparisons are made greatly influences the results, as broad comparisons that simultaneously analyze mutliple traits obscure heterogeneity in the direction and magnitude of these biases. We conclude that preferential fixation of mutations likely is common in nature, but should be studied on a trait‐by‐trait basis.},

Target site insensitivity to cardenolides has evolved convergently across six orders of insects, involving identical substitutions in the Na,K-ATPase gene and repeated convergent gene duplications. The large milkweed bug, Oncopeltus fasciatus, has three copies of the Na,K-ATPase α-subunit gene that bear differing numbers of amino acid substitutions in the binding pocket for cardenolides. To analyze the effect of these substitutions on cardenolide resistance and to infer possible trade-offs in gene function, we expressed the cardenolide-sensitive Na,K-ATPase of Drosophila melanogaster in vitro and introduced four distinct combinations of substitutions observed in the three gene copies of O. fasciatus. With an increasing number of substitutions, the sensitivity of the Na,K-ATPase to a standard cardenolide decreased in a stepwise manner. At the same time, the enzyme's overall activity decreased significantly with increasing cardenolide resistance and only the least substituted mimic of the Na,K-ATPase α1C copy maintained activity similar to the wild-type enzyme. Our results suggest that the Na,K-ATPase copies in O. fasciatus have diverged in function, enabling specific adaptations to dietary cardenolides while maintaining the functionality of this critical ion carrier.},

Nine different human Na,K-ATPase isozymes, composed of 3 α and β isoforms, were expressed in \textit{Xenopus} oocytes and were analyzed for their transport and pharmacological properties. According to ouabain binding and K$^{\textrm{+}}$-activated pump current measurements, all human isozymes are functional but differ in their turnover rates depending on the α isoform. On the other hand, variations in external K$^{\textrm{+}}$ activation are determined by a cooperative interaction mechanism between α and β isoforms with α2-β2 complexes having the lowest apparent K$^{\textrm{+}}$ affinity. α Isoforms influence the apparent internal Na$^{\textrm{+}}$ affinity in the order α1 {\textgreater} α2 {\textgreater} α3 and the voltage dependence in the order α2 {\textgreater} α1 {\textgreater} α3. All human Na,K-ATPase isozymes have a similar, high affinity for ouabain. However, α2-β isozymes exhibit more rapid ouabain association as well as dissociation rate constants than α1-β and α3-β isozymes. Finally, isoform-specific differences exist in the K$^{\textrm{+}}$/ouabain antagonism which may protect α1 but not α2 or α3 from digitalis inhibition at physiological K$^{\textrm{+}}$ levels. In conclusion, our study reveals several new functional characteristics of human Na,K-ATPase isozymes which help to better understand their role in ion homeostasis in different tissues and in digitalis action and toxicity.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

At present, as many as four different alpha-polypeptides (alpha1, alpha2, alpha3, and alpha4) and three distinct beta-isoforms (beta1, beta2, and beta3) have been identified in mammalian cells. The stringent constraints on the structure of the Na pump isozymes during evolution and their tissue-specific and developmental pattern of expression suggests that the different Na-K-ATPases have evolved distinct properties to respond to cellular requirements. This review focuses on the functional properties, regulation, and possible physiological relevance of the Na pump isozymes. The coexistence of multiple alpha- and beta-isoforms in most cells has hindered the understanding of the roles of the individual polypeptides. The use of heterologous expression systems has helped circumvent this problem. The kinetic characteristics of different Na-K-ATPase isozymes to the activating cations (Na+ and K+), the substrate ATP, and the inhibitors Ca2+ and ouabain demonstrate that each isoform has distinct properties. In addition, intracellular messengers differentially regulate the activity of the individual Na-K-ATPase isozymes. Thus the regulation of specific Na pump isozymes gives cells the ability to precisely coordinate Na-K-ATPase activity to their physiological requirements.},

Two of the main methods that biologists now use to solve such problems are maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum parsimony (MP); distance methods constitute a third approach, which will not be discussed here. ML seeks to find the tree topology that confers the highest probability on the observed characteristics of tip species. MP seeks to find the tree topology that requires the fewest changes in character state to produce the characteristics of those tip species. Besides saying what the “best” tree is for a given data set, both methods also provide an ordering of trees, from best to worst. The two methods sometimes disagree about this ordering—most vividly, when they disagree about which tree is best supported by the evidence. For this reason, biologists have had to address this methodological dispute head on, rather than setting it aside as a merely “philosophical” dispute of dubious relevance to scientists “in the trenches.”},

	abstract = {The oft-repeated claim that Earth’s biota is entering a sixth “mass extinction” depends on clearly demonstrating that current extinction rates are far above the “background” rates prevailing between the five previous mass extinctions. Earlier estimates of extinction rates have been criticized for using assumptions that might overestimate the severity of the extinction crisis. We assess, using extremely conservative assumptions, whether human activities are causing a mass extinction. First, we use a recent estimate of a background rate of 2 mammal extinctions per 10,000 species per 100 years (that is, 2 E/MSY), which is twice as high as widely used previous estimates. We then compare this rate with the current rate of mammal and vertebrate extinctions. The latter is conservatively low because listing a species as extinct requires meeting stringent criteria. Even under our assumptions, which would tend to minimize evidence of an incipient mass extinction, the average rate of vertebrate species loss over the last century is up to 100 times higher than the background rate. Under the 2 E/MSY background rate, the number of species that have gone extinct in the last century would have taken, depending on the vertebrate taxon, between 800 and 10,000 years to disappear. These estimates reveal an exceptionally rapid loss of biodiversity over the last few centuries, indicating that a sixth mass extinction is already under way. Averting a dramatic decay of biodiversity and the subsequent loss of ecosystem services is still possible through intensified conservation efforts, but that window of opportunity is rapidly closing.},

Multiple pathologic conditions associated with the perineurium have been described. Perineurial invasion is considered an important prognostic factor in several malignant neoplasms. Perineuriomas are true benign infrequent perineurial cell neoplasms that have been divided in 2 categories: those with intraneural localization and a more common extraneural (soft tissue) group, including sclerosing and reticular variants. Sporadic cases of malignant perineuromas have been reported. Interestingly, neurofibromas and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors may also display perineurial cell differentiation. The histologic appearance of perineuriomas may overlap with other soft tissue spindle cell neoplasms. Immunohistochemistry is imperative for the diagnosis, although in certain cases ultrastructural studies may be needed. Typical perineuriomas are positive for epithelial membrane antigen, glucose transporter-1-1, and claudin-1, and negative for S-100 protein and neurofilaments. Perineuriomas have mostly simple karyotypes, with one or few chromosomal rearrangements or numerical changes and it seems that specific cytogenetic aberrations may correlate with perineurioma subtype.},

Various substances and conditions have been shown to affect the maintenance of the intestinal epithelial tight junction barrier.

	abstract = {The cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) are thiolate heme proteins that can, often under physiological conditions, catalyze many distinct oxidative transformations on a wide variety of molecules, including relatively simple alkanes or fatty acids, as well as more complex compounds such as steroids and exogenous pollutants. They perform such impressive chemistry utilizing a sophisticated catalytic cycle that involves a series of consecutive chemical transformations of heme prosthetic group. Each of these steps provides a unique spectral signature that reflects changes in oxidation or spin states, deformation of the porphyrin ring or alteration of dioxygen moieties. For a long time, the focus of cytochrome P450 research was to understand the underlying reaction mechanism of each enzymatic step, with the biggest challenge being identification and characterization of the powerful oxidizing intermediates. Spectroscopic methods, such as electronic absorption (UV–Vis), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR), Mössbauer, X-ray absorption (XAS), and resonance Raman (rR), have been useful tools in providing multifaceted and detailed mechanistic insights into the biophysics and biochemistry of these fascinating enzymes. The combination of spectroscopic techniques with novel approaches, such as cryoreduction and Nanodisc technology, allowed for generation, trapping and characterizing long sought transient intermediates, a task that has been difficult to achieve using other methods. Results obtained from the UV–Vis, rR and EPR spectroscopies are the main focus of this review, while the remaining spectroscopic techniques are briefly summarized.

However, the molecular evolution of P450s in terms of their dynamics both at protein and DNA levels and functional conservation across kingdoms still needs investigation. In this study, we analyzed 17 598 P450s belonging to 113 P450 families (bacteria −42; fungi −19; plant −28; animal −22; plant and animal −1 and common P450 family −1) and found highly conserved and rapidly evolving P450 families. Results suggested that bacterial P450s, particularly P450s belonging to mycobacteria, are highly conserved both at protein and DNA levels. Mycobacteria possess the highest P450 diversity percentage compared to other microbes and have a high coverage of P450s (≥1\%) in their genomes, as found in fungi and plants. Phylogenetic and functional analyses revealed the functional conservation of P450s despite belonging to different biological kingdoms, suggesting the adherence of P450s to their innate function such as their involvement in either generation or oxidation of steroids and structurally related molecules, fatty acids and terpenoids. This study’s results offer new understanding of the dynamic structural nature of P450s.},

	abstract = {Interactions between plants and herbivorous insects have been models for theories of specialization and co-evolution for over a century. Phytochemicals govern many aspects of these interactions and have fostered the evolution of adaptations by insects to tolerate or even specialize on plant defensive chemistry. While genomic approaches are providing new insights into the genes and mechanisms insect specialists employ to tolerate plant secondary metabolites, open questions remain about the evolution and conservation of insect counterdefences, how insects respond to the diversity defences mounted by their host plants, and the costs and benefits of resistance and tolerance to plant defences in natural ecological communities. Using a milkweed-specialist aphid (Aphis nerii) model, we test the effects of host plant species with increased toxicity, likely driven primarily by increased secondary metabolites, on aphid life history traits and whole-body gene expression. We show that more toxic plant species have a negative effect on aphid development and lifetime fecundity. When feeding on more toxic host plants with higher levels of secondary metabolites, aphids regulate a narrow, targeted set of genes, including those involved in canonical detoxification processes (e.g., cytochrome P450s, hydrolases, UDP-glucuronosyltransferases and ABC transporters). These results indicate that A. nerii marshal a variety of metabolic detoxification mechanisms to circumvent milkweed toxicity and facilitate host plant specialization, yet, despite these detoxification mechanisms, aphids experience reduced fitness when feeding on more toxic host plants. Disentangling how specialist insects respond to challenging host plants is a pivotal step in understanding the evolution of specialized diet breadths.},

Chemical insecticides remain the first line of defence but the control of diseases, especially malaria and dengue fever, is being increasingly undermined by insecticide resistance. Mosquitoes have a large repertoire of P450s (over 100 genes). By pinpointing the key enzymes associated with insecticide resistance we can begin to develop new tools to aid the implementation of control interventions and reduce their environmental impact on Earth. Recent technological advances are helping us to build a functional profile of the P450 determinants of insecticide metabolic resistance in mosquitoes. Alongside, the cross-responses of mosquito P450s to insecticides and pollutants are also being investigated. Such research will provide the means to produce diagnostic tools for early detection of P450s linked to resistance. It will also enable the design of new insecticides with optimized efficacy in different environments.},

	abstract = {The irreversible nature of reactions catalysed by P450s makes these enzymes landmarks in the evolution of plant metabolic pathways. Founding members of P450 families are often associated with general (i.e. primary) metabolic pathways, restricted to single copy or very few representatives, indicative of purifying selection. Recruitment of those and subsequent blooms into multi-member gene families generates genetic raw material for functional diversification, which is an inherent characteristic of specialized (i.e. secondary) metabolism. However, a growing number of highly specialized P450s from not only the CYP71 clan indicate substantial contribution of convergent and divergent evolution to the observed general and specialized metabolite diversity. We will discuss examples of how the genetic and functional diversification of plant P450s drives chemical diversity in light of plant evolution. Even though it is difficult to predict the function or substrate of a P450 based on sequence similarity, grouping with a family or subfamily in phylogenetic trees can indicate association with metabolism of particular classes of compounds. Examples will be given that focus on multi-member gene families of P450s involved in the metabolic routes of four classes of specialized metabolites: cyanogenic glucosides, glucosinolates, mono- to triterpenoids and phenylpropanoids.},

	abstract = {Lignin is a major component of secondarily thickened plant cell walls and is considered to be the second most abundant biopolymer on the planet. At one point believed to be the product of a highly controlled polymerization procedure involving just three potential monomeric components (monolignols), it is becoming increasingly clear that the composition of lignin is quite flexible. Furthermore, the biosynthetic pathways to the major monolignols also appear to exhibit flexibility, particularly as regards the early reactions leading to the formation of caffeic acid from coumaric acid. The operation of parallel pathways to caffeic acid occurring at the level of shikimate esters or free acids may help provide robustness to the pathway under different physiological conditions. Several features of the pathway also appear to link monolignol biosynthesis to both generation and detoxification of hydrogen peroxide, one of the oxidants responsible for creating monolignol radicals for polymerization in the apoplast. Monolignol transport to the apoplast is not well understood. It may involve passive diffusion, although this may be targeted to sites of lignin initiation/polymerization by ordered complexes of both biosynthetic enzymes on the cytosolic side of the plasma membrane and structural anchoring of proteins for monolignol oxidation and polymerization on the apoplastic side. We present several hypothetical models to illustrate these ideas and stimulate further research. These are based primarily on studies in model systems, which may or may not reflect the major lignification process in forest trees.},

	abstract = {Because cardenolides specifically inhibit the Na+K+-ATPase, insects feeding on cardenolide-containing plants need to circumvent this toxic effect. Some insects such as the monarch butterfly rely on target site insensitivity, yet other cardenolide-adapted lepidopterans such as the oleander hawk-moth, Daphnis nerii, possess highly sensitive Na+K+-ATPases. Nevertheless, larvae of this species and the related Manduca sexta are insensitive to injected cardenolides. By radioactive-binding assays with nerve cords of both species, we demonstrate that the perineurium surrounding the nervous tissue functions as a diffusion barrier for a polar cardenolide (ouabain). By contrast, for non-polar cardenolides such as digoxin an active efflux carrier limits the access to the nerve cord. This barrier can be abolished by metabolic inhibitors and by verapamil, a specific inhibitor of P-glycoproteins (PGPs). This supports that a PGP-like transporter is involved in the active cardenolide-barrier of the perineurium. Tissue specific RT-PCR demonstrated expression of three PGP-like genes in hornworm nerve cords, and immunohistochemistry further corroborated PGP expression in the perineurium. Our results thus suggest that the lepidopteran perineurium serves as a diffusion barrier for polar cardenolides and provides an active barrier for non-polar cardenolides. This may explain the high in vivo resistance to cardenolides observed in some lepidopteran larvae, despite their highly sensitive Na+K+-ATPases.},

In addition, we analysed cardenolide resistance of their Na+/K+-ATPases, the molecular target of cardenolides. Our data indicate that cardenolide sequestration and cardenolide-resistant Na+/K+-ATPase are basal adaptations in the Lygaeinae. In two species that shifted to non-apocynaceous hosts, the ability to sequester was secondarily reduced, yet Na+/K+-ATPase resistance was maintained. We suggest that both traits evolved together and represent major coevolutionary adaptations responsible for the evolutionary success of lygaeine bugs. Moreover, specialization on cardenolides was not an evolutionary dead end, but enabled this insect lineage to host shift to cardenolide-producing plants from distantly related families.},

	abstract = {In a variety of aposematic species, the conspicuousness of an individual's warning signal and the quantity of its chemical defence are positively correlated. This apparent honest signalling is predicted by resource competition models which assume that the production and maintenance of aposematic defences compete for access to antioxidant molecules that have dual functions as pigments and in protecting against oxidative damage. To test for such trade-offs, we raised monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) on different species of their milkweed host plants (Apocynaceae) that vary in quantities of cardenolides to test whether (i) the sequestration of cardenolides as a secondary defence is associated with costs in the form of oxidative lipid damage and reduced antioxidant defences; and (ii) lower oxidative state is associated with a reduced capacity to produce aposematic displays. In male monarchs conspicuousness was explained by an interaction between oxidative damage and sequestration: males with high levels of oxidative damage became less conspicuous with increased sequestration of cardenolides, whereas those with low oxidative damage became more conspicuous with increased levels of cardenolides. There was no significant effect of oxidative damage or concentration of sequestered cardenolides on female conspicuousness. Our results demonstrate a physiological linkage between the production of coloration and oxidative state, and differential costs of sequestration and signalling in monarch butterflies.},

It was found that the adult D. chrysippus is a poor and inconsistent storer of cardiac glycosides compared with D. plexippus, and contained, chiefly, highly polar cardenolides. Populations in East Africa are, on the whole, more efficient storers than those from West Africa, a factor which may contribute to the dearth of mimics in West Africa. Furthermore there appears to be a genetic element in the storage capacity of these butterflies, not merely a ‘mirror’ effect, depending on the cardenolide content of their food plants. Differences in storage capacity were shown between morphs alcippus from both Sierra Leone and Dar-es-Salaam and aegyptius from Tanzania and Dar-es-Salaam, reared side by side on the same tested food plants. In both cases aegyptius was the better storer but in other broods from Kenya, reared on Asclepias rich in cardenolides, this morph was negative for these substances. During the investigation strains of Asclepias curassavica were found which contained calotropin, but lacked calactin. D. plexippus reared on these plants also lacked calactin, but sequestered and stored it when fed on Gomphocarpus fruticosus which contained both substances. The methods for analysing cardenolides of this type are described. Maps are presented showing the distribution of the three principal morphs of D. chrysippus and the form albinus in Africa.},

	abstract = {Phytophagous insects can tolerate and detoxify toxic compounds present in their host plants and have evolved intricate adaptations to this end. Some insects even sequester the toxins for their defence. This necessitates specific mechanisms, especially carrier proteins that regulate uptake and transport to specific storage sites or protect sensitive tissues from noxious compounds. We identified three ATP-binding cassette subfamily B (ABCB) transporters from the transcriptome of the cardenolide-sequestering leaf beetle Chrysochus auratus and analysed their functional role in the sequestration process. These were heterologously expressed and tested for their ability to interact with various potential substrates: verapamil (standard ABCB substrate), the cardenolides digoxin (commonly used), cymarin (present in the species's host plant) and calotropin (present in the ancestral host plants). Verapamil stimulated all three ABCBs and each was activated by at least one cardenolide, however, they differed as to which they were activated by. While the expression of the most versatile transporter fits with a protective role in the blood–brain barrier, the one specific for cymarin shows an extreme abundance in the elytra, coinciding with the location of the defensive glands. Our data thus suggest a key role of ABCBs in the transport network needed for cardenolide sequestration.},

Here we present a draft 6.5 Gb genome sequence of Locusta migratoria, which is the largest animal genome sequenced so far. Our findings indicate that the large genome size of L. migratoria is likely to be because of transposable element proliferation combined with slow rates of loss for these elements. Methylome and transcriptome analyses reveal complex regulatory mechanisms involved in microtubule dynamic-mediated synapse plasticity during phase change. We find significant expansion of gene families associated with energy consumption and detoxification, consistent with long-distance flight capacity and phytophagy. We report hundreds of potential insecticide target genes, including cys-loop ligand-gated ion channels, G-protein-coupled receptors and lethal genes. The L. migratoria genome sequence offers new insights into the biology and sustainable management of this pest species, and will promote its wide use as a model system.},

We report here the molecular cloning and functional characterization of a phenol UDP-glucosyltransferase (UGT) from the silkworm, Bombyx mori, which was named BmUGT1. The complete cDNA clone is 1.6 kb, and the gene is expressed in several tissues of fifth-instar larvae, including fat body, midgut, integument, testis, silk gland and haemocytes. The predicted protein comprises 520 amino acids and has ≈ 30\% overall amino-acid identity with other members of the UGT family. The most conserved region of the protein is the C-terminal half, which has been implicated in binding the UDP-sugar. BmUGT1 was expressed in insect cells using the baculovirus expression system, and a range of compounds belonging to diverse chemical groups were assessed as potential substrates for the enzyme. The expressed enzyme had a wide substrate specificity, showing activity with flavonoids, coumarins, terpenoids and simple phenols. These results support a role for the enzyme in detoxication processes, such as minimizing the harmful effects of ingested plant allelochemicals. This work represents the first instance where an insect ugt gene has been associated with a specific enzyme activity.},

	abstract = {1. The uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT) are a family of enzymes that catalyse the covalent addition of glucuronic acid to a wide range of lipophilic chemicals. They play a major role in the detoxification of many exogenous and endogenous compounds by generating products that are more polar and, thus, more readily excreted in bile or urine. 2. Inherited deficiencies in UGT forms are deleterious, as exemplified by the debilitating effects of hyperbilirubinaemia and neurotoxicity in subjects with mutations in the enzyme that converts bilirubin to its more pola. glucuronide. 3. The UGT protein can be conceptually divided into two domains with the amino-terminal half of the protein demonstrating greater sequence divergence between isoforms. This region apparently determines aglycone specificity. The aglycone binding site is presumed to be a ‘loose’ fit, as many structurally diverse substrates can be bound by the same UGT isoform. The carboxyl-terminal half, which is more conserved in sequence between different isoforms, is believed to contain a binding site for the cosubstrate UDP glucuronic acid (UDPGA). 4. Uridine diphosphat. glucuronosyltransfera.se is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and spans the membrane with a type I topology. The putative transmembrane domain is located near the carboxyl terminus of the protein such that only a small portion of the protein resides in the cytosol. This cytosolic tail is believed to contain an ER-targeting signal. The major portion of the protein is located in the ER lumen, including the proposed substrate-binding domains and the catalytic site. 5. The microsomal membrane impedes the access of UDPGA to the active site, resulting in latency of UGT activity in intact ER-derived microsomes. Active transport of UDPGA is believed to occur in hepatocytes, but the transport system has not been fully characterized. Uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransfer-ase activity is also highly lipid dependent and the enzyme may contain regions of membrane association in addition to the transmembrane domain.},

I emphasize key steps in cellular evolution important for ordering and timing the major evolutionary innovations in the history of the biosphere, explaining especially the origins of the eukaryote cell and of bacterial flagella and cell envelope novelties. Second, I map the tree onto the fossil record and discuss dates of key events and their biogeochemical impact. Finally, I present a broad synthesis, discussing evidence for a three-phase history of life. The first phase began perhaps ca 3.5 Gyr ago, when the origin of cells and anoxic photosynthesis generated the arguably most primitive prokaryote phylum, Chlorobacteria (= Chloroflexi), the first negibacteria with cells bounded by two acyl ester phospholipid membranes. After this 'chlorobacterial age' of benthic anaerobic evolution protected from UV radiation by mineral grains, two momentous quantum evolutionary episodes of cellular innovation and microbial radiation dramatically transformed the Earth's surface: the glycobacterial revolution initiated an oxygenic 'age of cyanobacteria' and, as the ozone layer grew, the rise of plankton; immensely later, probably as recently as ca 0.9 Gyr ago, the neomuran revolution ushered in the 'age of eukaryotes', Archaebacteria (arguably the youngest bacterial phylum), and morphological complexity. Diversification of glycobacteria ca 2.8 Gyr ago, predominantly inhabiting stratified benthic mats, I suggest caused serial depletion of 13C by ribulose 1,5-bis-phosphate caboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) to yield ultralight late Archaean organic carbon formerly attributed to methanogenesis plus methanotrophy. The late origin of archaebacterial methanogenesis ca 720 Myr ago perhaps triggered snowball Earth episodes by slight global warming increasing weathering and reducing CO2 levels, to yield runaway cooling; the origin of anaerobic methane oxidation ca 570 Myr ago reduced methane flux at source, stabilizing Phanerozoic climates. I argue that the major cellular innovations exhibit a pattern of quantum evolution followed by very rapid radiation and then substantial stasis, as described by Simpson. They yielded organisms that are a mosaic of extremely conservative and radically novel features, as characterized by De Beer's phrase 'mosaic evolution'. Evolution is not evenly paced and there are no real molecular clocks.},

	abstract = {A general—purpose detoxification enzyme system, known as the mixed—function oxidase (MFO) system, apparently protects generalist herbivores from defensive plant allelochemics. Previous studies limited to lepidopterous larvae show that the MFO system has the attributes of an effective biochemical defense, mainly because this system has been shown to occupy a key position in the primary degradation and inactivation of a wide variety of exogenous lipophilic substances, and its level increases rapidly via introduction by plant allochemics. The gut microsomal MFO system of the highly polyphagous Japanese beetle, Popilia japonica, is induced rapidly, attaining maximal level within 24 h of feeding on host plants. The order of induction is: field polyphagouf beetles {\textgreater} laboratory—simulated polyphagy {\textgreater} single—plant feeding. However, apparently the induction is not related to host preference of this herbivore, but probably occurs in response to host allelochemics. Single—plant feeding of three host plants: sassafras, broccoli, and phlox, as a group, produced MFO induction that was 83 and 67\%, respectively, of the level achieved in mixed plant feeding on a natural polyphagy. The Implication of this mode of substantial induction in single—plant feeding, in relation to the beetles' feeding habits immediately after emergence, is discussed. The beetle larvae clearly show that under faculatative monophagy, the MFO level is significantly lower than in polyphagy. Taken together, these data show that the MFO system in the Japanese beetle is highly flexible and is responsive not only to overall breadth of the diet, but also to the immediate feeding history.},

	abstract = {Large herbivores must select food from a wide variety of plant parts, species, and strains. These differ in nutritional value (protein, carbohydrate, etc.), toughness, spinosity, etc. Even greater differences are found in types and concentrations of secondary compounds. Every plant produces its own set of secondary chemical compounds, which to a great extent are unique to it or its species. Ingestion of natural concentrations of these compounds can lead to either death or severe physiological impairment. The ubiquitous nature of these compounds would make herbivory impossible unless animals had mechanisms for degrading and excreting them. An animal displaying no obvious symptoms of poisoning is not free of the problem of ridding itself of toxic compounds; if it is eating plants, it almost certainly has this problem. Herbivores are capable of detoxifying and eliminating secondary compounds. Limitations of these mechanisms force mammalian herbivores to consume a variety of plant foods at any one time, to treat new foods with caution, to ingest small amounts on the first encounter, and to sample food continuously. Selection of foods is based on learning in response to adverse internal physiological effects, and herbivores probably cannot predict these from the smell or taste of new foods. Herbivores prefer to eat familiar foods and can seek out and consume foods that rectify specific nutritional deficiencies induced by detoxification. They should prefer to feed on foods that contain small amounts of secondary compounds, and their body size and searching strategies should be adapted to optimize the number of types of foods available with respect to the total amount of food that can be eaten and will be present in the future. Natural selection can increase the efficiency of degrading particular secondary compounds. Specialist herbivores, like koala and mountain viscacha, are expected where a large amount of several related toxic foods is present in a year-round supply. However, few large herbivores are specialized on such a restricted range of foods.},

The catalysis of oxidations is largely understood in the context of the heme iron-oxygen complex generally referred to as Compound I, formally FeO3+, whose basis was in peroxidase chemistry. Many X-ray crystal structures of P450s are now available (≥ 822 structures from ≥146 different P450s) and have helped in understanding catalytic specificity. In addition to hydroxylations, P450s catalyze more complex oxidations, including C-C bond formation and cleavage. Enzymes derived from P450s by directed evolution can even catalyze more unusual reactions, e.g. cyclopropanation. Current P450 questions under investigation include the potential role of the intermediate Compound 0 (formally FeIII-O2 -) in catalysis of some reactions, the roles of high- and low-spin forms of Compound I, the mechanism of desaturation, the roles of open and closed structures of P450s in catalysis, the extent of processivity in multi-step oxidations, and the role of the accessory protein cytochrome b 5. More global questions include exactly how structure drives function, prediction of catalysis, and roles of multiple protein conformations.},

Resistance to webworms in wild parsnip populations is largely attributable to genetically based variation in furanocoumarin chemistry; by differentially reducing fruit set among chemical phenotypes, parsnip webworms may act as selective agents on wild parsnip populations. To determine whether wild parsnip chemistry can act as a selective agent on webworm populations, it is necessary to establish that resistance mechanisms in the webworm to furanocoumarins are genetically based. In this study, we estimated the amount of genetic variation in behavioral and physiological responses of webworms to parsnip furanocoumarins. Virtually no variation was found among webworm families for feeding preferences for diets varying as much as fourfold in furanocoumarin content. Nor was significant variation found for mean furanocoumarin intake over the assay period, except in one case, in which maternal effects may account for differences among families. In contrast, substantial familial variation existed for cytochrome P450–mediated metabolism of bergapten and xanthotoxin, two host furanocoumarins. The presence of additive genetic variation in metabolism, and the absence of such variation in discriminative feeding behavior, suggests that adaptation to changes in furanocoumarin chemistry, resulting either from changes in the distribution of chemical phenotypes in parsnip populations or from shifts to new chemically different host plants, is likely to be facilitated by physiological rather than behavioral means.},

In this study, we examined the importance of furanocoumarin chemistry in determining distribution patterns of the parsnip webworm (Depressaria pastinacella) in a population of its host plant, wild parsnip (Pastinaca sativa). Parsnip webworms feed almost exclusively on wild parsnip, a species that produces furanocoumarins, compounds that are toxic or deterrent to many insects. Samples of plants hosting actively feeding parsnip webworms (attacked) and plants exhibiting no damage (unattacked) were collected in the field and brought to the laboratory, where they were examined for content of three furanocoumarins, xanthotoxin, bergapten, and sphondin. In addition, they were bioassayed with ultimate—instar parsnip webworms; growth, consumption rate, and rate of in vitro metabolism of furanocoumarins were compared between larvae fed undamaged tissue from attacked plants and larvae fed tissue from unattacked plants. Attacked plants contained less than half the amount of xanthotoxin and sphondin, two of the three furanocoumarins assayed, than did unattacked plants. Growth and consumption rates of larvae fed tissue of unattacked plants also were reduced significantly (40 and 24\%, respectively) compared to larvae fed attacked plants. Moreover, in vitro metabolism of xanthotoxin and bergapten was reduced by 50\% in larvae fed tissue from unattacked plants compared to larvae fed tissues of attacked plants. Cluster analysis placed plants into three groups based on furanocoumarin chemistry. One group, characterized by high concentrations of all three furanocoumarins, contained only unattacked individuals. A second group consisting of plants intermediate in furanocoumarin concentration, contained predominantly unattacked individuals, and last group, characterized by low concentrations of all three furanocoumarins, was dominated by attacked individuals. When large larvae are fed plant tissues with below—average total furanocoumarin concentrations, consumption rate is the most important larval characteristic determining growth rate. However, when larvae are fed plant tissues with above—average concentrations of furanocoumarins, the capacity to metabolize furanocoumarins is also important. These results indicate that plant chemistry, relative to larval ability to tolerate plant chemicals, can to a large extent explain the distribution of this insect within a population of its host plant.},

	abstract = {The ubiquitous occurrence of series of biosynthetically related plant secondary compounds within individual species has given rise to the suggestion that such multiplicity is adaptive; one possible mechanism that would serve to maintain such within-plant diversity is analog synergism. In a series of experiments, we provide evidence that synergism may account for the presence of multiple structurally related furanocoumarins in apiaceous plants. The black swallowtail, Papilio polyxenes, feeds exclusively on plant species containing furanocoumarins. Growth of larvae fed parsley leaves treated with both xanthotoxin and angelicin, two furanocoumarins that co-occur widely in swallowtail hostplants, was significantly slower than that of larvae fed leaves with an equimolar concentration of either xanthotoxin or angelicin. A multivariate combination of growth, food consumption and frass excretion differed significantly between larvae fed leaves treated with both xanthotoxin and angelicin and larvae fed leaves treated with angelicin alone. In addition, we measured rates of in vitro cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism of three furanocoumarins — bergapten, xanthotoxin, and angelicin. While bergapten and xanthotoxin, both linear furanocoumarins, were metabolized at similar rates (8.07 and 9.86 nmoles/min/g fw caterpillar, respectively), angelicin, an angular furanocoumarin, was metabolized more slowly (2.76 nmoles/min/g fw caterpillar). When all three furanocoumarins were assayed together, overall rates of metabolism were significantly reduced, suggesting substrate inhibition. Thus, the pattern of growth of larvae is consistent with the pattern of in vitro metabolism and is evidence in support of analog synergism. In a separate experiment, metabolism of xanthotoxin and angelicin individually and together were compared in six maternal families. Again, angelicin was metabolized more slowly than xanthotoxin and each furanocoumarin inhibited metabolism of the other. That significant family effects were found for rates of metabolism and for the ratio of moles of angelicin metabolized for each mole of xanthotoxin metabolized raises the possibility that genetic variation exists for the rate and specificity of metabolism and suggests that insect herbivores may be able to adapt to analog synergism.},

However, little direct evidence demonstrates the relationship between selection by plant toxins and adaptive changes in herbivore P450s. Here we show that the furanocoumarin-metabolic activity of CYP6B proteins in two species of swallowtail caterpillars is associated with the probability of encountering host plant furanocoumarins. Catalytic activity was compared in two closely related CYP6B4 and CYP6B17 groups in the polyphagous congeners Papilio glaucus and Papilio canadensis. Generally, P450s from P. glaucus, which feeds occasionally on furanocoumarin-containing host plants, display higher activities against furanocoumarins than those from P. canadensis, which normally does not encounter furanocoumarins. These P450s in turn catalyze a larger range of furanocoumarins at lower efficiency than CYP6B1, a P450 from Papilio polyxenes, which feeds exclusively on furanocoumarin-containing host plants. Reconstruction of the ancestral CYP6B sequences using maximum likelihood predictions and comparisons of the sequence and geometry of their active sites to those of contemporary CYP6B proteins indicate that host plant diversity is directly related to P450 activity and inversely related to substrate specificity. These predictions suggest that, along the lineage leading to Papilio P450s, the ancestral, highly versatile CYP6B protein presumed to exist in a polyphagous species evolved through time into a more efficient and specialized CYP6B1-like protein in Papilio species with continual exposure to furanocoumarins. Further diversification of Papilio CYP6Bs has likely involved interspersed events of positive selection in oligophagous species and relaxation of functional constraints in polyphagous species.},

The inactivation of both P450s was NADPH-dependent and irreversible. The kinetic constants for the inactivation of the 7-ethoxy-4-(trifluoromethyl)coumarin O-deethylation activity of P450 2B6 were: KI, 5 μM; kinact 0.09 min–1; and t1/2, 8 min. The kinetic constants obtained for the inactivation of the testosterone 6β-hydroxylation activity of P450 3A5 were: KI, 20 μM; kinact 0.045 min–1; and t1/2, 15 min. Incubations of P450s 2B6 and 3A5 with 20 μM BG at 37°C for 20 min resulted in an ∼60\% loss in the catalytic activity that was accompanied by a significant loss in intact heme and a similar decrease in the reduced CO difference spectrum. The extrapolated partition ratios for BG with P450s 2B6 and 3A5 were ∼2 and ∼20, respectively. Liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy analysis of the BG-inactivated samples showed that the mass of the inactivated apoprotein had increased by approximately 388 Da for both P450 2B6 and P450 3A5. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis demonstrated that [14C]BG was irreversibly bound to the apoprotein in the BG-inactivated samples. The stoichiometry of binding was ∼0.5 mol BG metabolite/mol of each P450 inactivated. High-pressure liquid chromatography analysis of the metabolites of BG showed that P450 2B6 generated two major metabolites, whereas P450 3A5 generated three additional metabolites. Two of metabolites were identified as 6′,7′-dihydroxybergamottin and bergaptol.},

To be an effective antioxidant physiologically, a substance must have certain chemical and biological properties: it must be present in adequate amounts in the body; it must react with a variety of R∗; it must be suitable for compartmentation; it must be readily available; it might be suitable for regeneration; it must be conserved by the kidneys; and it must have tolerable toxicity.

Knowledge of the difficulties with older ascorbate assays may help to explain why formulations for ascorbate function are just emerging now. The earliest physicians did not know what ascorbic acid was, but they clearly were familiar with the end results of lack of ascorbate in the diet. The first chemically stable product in the oxidation of ascorbic acid is dehydroascorbate. For a basic understanding of the dehydroascorbate/ascorbate redox pair, it is easiest to conceptualize the two species as existing under some equilibrium. The conditions of the equilibrium are influenced not only by the original concentrations of the two species but by light, pH, and possibly temperature.},

GSTs can metabolize insecticides by facilitating their reductive dehydrochlorination or by conjugation reactions with reduced glutathione, to produce water-soluble metabolites that are more readily excreted. In addition, they contribute to the removal of toxic oxygen free radical species produced through the action of pesticides. Annotation of the Anopheles gambiae and Drosophila melanogaster genomes has revealed the full extent of this enzyme family in insects.

The ancestral defense is based on the de novo synthesis of monoterpene iridoids. The catabolization of the host-plant O-glucoside salicin into salicylaldehyde is a character state that evolved later in two distinct lineages, which specialized on Salicaceae. By using two species producing monoterpenes (Hydrothassa marginella and Phratora laticollis) and two sequestering species (Chrysomela populi and Phratora vitellinae), we studied the molecular basis of sequestration by feeding the larvae structurally different thioglucosides resembling natural O-glucosides. Their accumulation in the defensive systems demonstrated that the larvae possess transport systems, which are evolutionarily adapted to the glycosides of their host plants. Minor structural modifications in the aglycon result in drastically reduced transport rates of the test compounds. Moreover, the ancestral iridoid-producing leaf beetles already possess a fully functional import system for an early precursor of the iridoid defenses. Our data confirm an evolutionary scenario in which, after a host-plant change, the transport system of the leaf beetles may play a pivotal role in the adaptation on new hosts by selecting plant-derived glucosides that can be channeled to the defensive system.},

This example of micro-evolution has been thoroughly investigated as an opportunity to assess precisely both the new adapted phenotypes and the associated genetic changes. A notable feature is that OP resistance is achieved with few genes, and these genes have generally large effects. The molecular events generating such resistance genes are complex (e.g., gene amplification, gene regulation) potentially explaining their low frequency of de novo occurrence. In contrast, migration is a frequent event, including passive transportation between distant populations. This generates a complex interaction between mutations and migration, and promotes competition among resistance alleles. When the precise physiological action of each gene product is rather well known, it is possible to understand the dominance level or the type of epistasis observed. It is however difficult to predict a priori how resistance genes will interact, and it is too early to state whether or not this will be ever possible. These resistance genes are costly, and the cost is variable among them. It is usually believed that the initial fitness cost would gradually decrease due to subsequent mutations with a modifier effect. In the present example, a particular modifier occurred (a gene duplication) at one resistance locus, whereas at the other one reduction of cost is driven by allele replacement and apparently not by selection of modifiers.},

However, due to fast growing resistance in the targeted insects, negative impact on humans and non-target organisms as well as the environment, there is an urgent need to search some safer alternatives of these xenobiotics. Many essential oils (EOs) and their bioactive compounds have received particular attention for application as botanical pesticides, since they exhibited high insecticidal efficacy, diverse mode of action, and favourable safety profiles on mammalian system as well as to the non-target organisms. Data collected from scientific articles show that these EOs and their bioactive compounds exhibited insecticidal activity via fumigant, contact, repellent, antifeedant, ovicidal, oviposition deterrent and larvicidal activity, and by inhibiting/altering important neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine esterase (AChE) and octopamine or neurotransmitter inhibitor γ-amino butyric acid (GABA), as well as by altering the enzymatic [superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidases (POx), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and glutathione reductase (GR)] and non-enzymatic [glutathione (GSH)] antioxidant defence systems. However, in spite of promising pesticidal efficacy against storage pests, the practical application of EOs and their bioactive compounds in real food systems remain rather limited because of their high volatility, poor water solubility and susceptibility towards degradation. Nanoencapsulation/nanoemulsion of EOs is currently considered as a promising tool that improved water solubility, enhanced bio-efficacy, stability and controlled release, thereby expanding their applicability.},

	abstract = {The tobacco cutworm, Spodoptera litura, is among the most widespread and destructive agricultural pests, feeding on over 100 crops throughout tropical and subtropical Asia. By genome sequencing, physical mapping and transcriptome analysis, we found that the gene families encoding receptors for bitter or toxic substances and detoxification enzymes, such as cytochrome P450, carboxylesterase and glutathione-S-transferase, were massively expanded in this polyphagous species, enabling its extraordinary ability to detect and detoxify many plant secondary compounds. Larval exposure to insecticidal toxins induced expression of detoxification genes, and knockdown of representative genes using short interfering RNA (siRNA) reduced larval survival, consistent with their contribution to the insect’s natural pesticide tolerance. A population genetics study indicated that this species expanded throughout southeast Asia by migrating along a South India–South China–Japan axis, adapting to wide-ranging ecological conditions with diverse host plants and insecticides, surviving and adapting with the aid of its expanded detoxification systems. The findings of this study will enable the development of new pest management strategies for the control of major agricultural pests such as S. litura.},

	abstract = {Studies of the genetic regulation involved in drug metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters are of great interest to understand the molecular mechanisms of drug response and toxic events. Recent reports have revealed that hydrophobic ligands and several nuclear receptors are involved in the induction or down-regulation of various enzymes and transporters involved in Phase I, II, and III xenobiotic metabolizing systems. Nuclear receptors (NRs) form a family of ligand-activated transcription factors (TFs). These proteins modulate the regulation of target genes by contacting their promoter or enhancer sequences at specific recognition sites. These target genes include metabolizing enzymes such as cytochrome P450s (CYPs), transporters, and NRs. Thus it was now recognized that these NRs play essential role in sensing processing xenobiotic substances including drugs, environmental chemical pollutants and nutritional ingredients. From literature, we picked up target genes of each NR in xenobiotic response systems. Possible cross-talk, by which xenobiotics may exert undesirable effects, was listed. For example, the role of NRs was comprehensively drawn up in cholesterol and bile acid homeostasis in human hepatocyte. Summarizing current states of related research, especially for in silico response element search, we tried to elucidate nuclear receptor mediated xenobiotic processing loops and direct future research.},

	abstract = {Drug metabolizing enzymes (DMEs) play central roles in the metabolism, elimination and detoxification of xenobiotics and drugs introduced into the human body. Most of the tissues and organs in our body are well equipped with diverse and various DMEs including phase I, phase II metabolizing enzymes and phase III transporters, which are present in abundance either at the basal unstimulated level, and/or are inducible at elevated level after exposure to xenobiotics. Recently, many important advances have been made in the mechanisms that regulate the expression of these drug metabolism genes. Various nuclear receptors including the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), orphan nuclear receptors, and nuclear factor-erythoroid 2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2) have been shown to be the key mediators of drug-induced changes in phase I, phase II metabolizing enzymes as well as phase III transporters involved in efflux mechanisms. For instance, the expression of CYP1 genes can be induced by AhR, which dimerizes with the AhR nuclear translocator (Arnt), in response to many polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs). Similarly, the steroid family of orphan nuclear receptors, the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and pregnane X receptor (PXR), both heterodimerize with the retinoid X receptor (RXR), are shown to transcriptionally activate the promoters of CYP2B and CYP3A gene expression by xenobiotics such as phenobarbital-like compounds (CAR) and dexamethasone and rifampin-type of agents (PXR). The peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR), which is one of the first characterized members of the nuclear hormone receptor, also dimerizes with RXR and has been shown to be activated by lipid lowering agent fibrate-type of compounds leading to transcriptional activation of the promoters on CYP4A gene. CYP7A was recognized as the first target gene of the liver X receptor (LXR), in which the elimination of cholesterol depends on CYP7A. Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) was identified as a bile acid receptor, and its activation results in the inhibition of hepatic acid biosynthesis and increased transport of bile acids from intestinal lumen to the liver, and CYP7A is one of its target genes. The transcriptional activation by these receptors upon binding to the promoters located at the 5-flanking region of these CYP genes generally leads to the induction of their mRNA gene expression. The physiological and the pharmacological implications of common partner of RXR for CAR, PXR, PPAR, LXR and FXR receptors largely remain unknown and are under intense investigations. For the phase II DMEs, phase II gene inducers such as the phenolic compounds butylated hydroxyanisol (BHA), tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ), green tea polyphenol (GTP), (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and the isothiocyanates (PEITC, sulforaphane) generally appear to be electrophiles. They generally possess electrophilic-mediated stress response, resulting in the activation of bZIP transcription factors Nrf2 which dimerizes with Mafs and binds to the antioxidant/electrophile response element (ARE/EpRE) promoter, which is located in many phase II DMEs as well as many cellular defensive enzymes such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), with the subsequent induction of the expression of these genes. Phase III transporters, for example, P-glycoprotein (P-gp), multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRPs), and organic anion transporting polypeptide 2 (OATP2) are expressed in many tissues such as the liver, intestine, kidney, and brain, and play crucial roles in drug absorption, distribution, and excretion. The orphan nuclear receptors PXR and CAR have been shown to be involved in the regulation of these transporters. Along with phase I and phase II enzyme induction, pretreatment with several kinds of inducers has been shown to alter the expression of phase III transporters, and alter the excretion of xenobiotics, which implies that phase III transporters may also be similarly regulated in a coordinated fashion, and provides an important mean to protect the body from xenobiotics insults. It appears that in general, exposure to phase I, phase II and phase III gene inducers may trigger cellular "stress" response leading to the increase in their gene expression, which ultimately enhance the elimination and clearance of these xenobiotics and/or other "cellular stresses" including harmful reactive intermediates such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), so that the body will remove the "stress" expeditiously. Consequently, this homeostatic response of the body plays a central role in the protection of the body against "environmental" insults such as those elicited by exposure to xenobiotics.},

	abstract = {Cytochrome P450 (P450) and uridine 5'-diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) catalyze oxidation and glucuronidation in drug metabolism, respectively. It is believed that P450 and UGT work separately because they perform distinct reactions and exhibit opposite membrane topologies on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). However, given that some chemicals are sequentially metabolized by P450 and UGT, it is reasonable to consider that the enzymes may interact and work cooperatively. Previous research by our team detected protein-protein interactions between P450 and UGT by analyzing solubilized rat liver microsomes with P450-immobilized affinity column chromatography. Although P450 and UGT have been known to form homo- and hetero-oligomers, this is the first report indicating a P450-UGT association. Based on our previous study, we focused on the P450-UGT interaction and reported lines of evidence that the P450-UGT association is a functional protein-protein interaction that can alter the enzymatic capabilities, including enhancement or suppression of the activities of P450 and UGT, helping UGT to acquire novel regioselectivity, and inhibiting substrate binding to P450. Biochemical and molecular bioscientific approaches suggested that P450 and UGT interact with each other at their internal hydrophobic domains in the ER membrane. Furthermore, several in vivo studies have reported the presence of a functional P450-UGT association under physiological conditions. The P450-UGT interaction is expected to function as a novel post-translational factor for inter-individual differences in the drug-metabolizing enzymes.},

The transport of MTX was competitively inhibited by phenol red and probenecid; non-competitively inhibited by salicylate, verapamil and MK-571; and uncompetitively inhibited by Texas Red. Dietary exposure to 0.1mM MTX led to dramatic increases in gene expression for several members of the ABC family of transporters in both the Malpighian tubules and the gut. Our results suggest that multiple transporters are upregulated in response to dietary exposure to MTX. Increased levels of the protein products which may result from expression of these genes may enhance elimination of toxic compounds such as MTX or its metabolites.},

In addition, exposure to natural or synthetic toxins is commonly associated with increases in the activity of detoxification enzymes such as the P450 monoxygenases (P450s) and the glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs). We examined the links between mechanisms for detoxification and excretion in adult Drosophila melanogaster using functional assays and measurements of changes in gene expression by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR in response to dietary exposure to compounds known to alter activity or gene expression of P450s and GSTs. Dietary exposure to phenol, which alters gene expression for multiple GSTs after seven to 10 generations, was also associated with an increase (more than twofold) in secretion of the organic anion methotrexate (MTX) by isolated tubules. Dietary exposure to the insecticide synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO) was associated with reduced expression of two P450 genes (Cyp4e2, Cyp4p1) and two GST genes (GstD1, GstD5) in the tubules, as well as increased expression of Cyp12d1 and GstE1. Thin layer chromatographic analysis of fluid secreted by isolated tubules indicated that dietary exposure to PBO resulted in increased levels of an MTX metabolite. In addition, exposure to PBO altered the expression of transporter genes in the tubules, including a Drosophila multidrug resistance-associated protein, and was associated with a 73\% increase in MTX secretion by isolated tubules. The results suggest that exposure of Drosophila to toxins evokes a coordinated response by the Malpighian tubules, involving both alterations in detoxification pathways as well as enhanced transport.},

	abstract = {About a 100 years ago, the Drosophila white mutant marked the birth of Drosophila genetics. The white gene turned out to encode the first well studied ABC transporter in arthropods. The ABC gene family is now recognized as one of the largest transporter families in all kingdoms of life. The majority of ABC proteins function as primary-active transporters that bind and hydrolyze ATP while transporting a large diversity of substrates across lipid membranes. Although extremely well studied in vertebrates for their role in drug resistance, less is known about the role of this family in the transport of endogenous and exogenous substances in arthropods. The ABC families of five insect species, a crustacean and a chelicerate have been annotated in some detail. We conducted a thorough phylogenetic analysis of the seven arthropod and human ABC protein subfamilies, to infer orthologous relationships that might suggest conserved function. Most orthologous relationships were found in the ABCB half transporter, ABCD, ABCE and ABCF subfamilies, but specific expansions within species and lineages are frequently observed and discussed. We next surveyed the role of ABC transporters in the transport of xenobiotics/plant allelochemicals and their involvement in insecticide resistance. The involvement of ABC transporters in xenobiotic resistance in arthropods is historically not well documented, but an increasing number of studies using unbiased differential gene expression analysis now points to their importance. We give an overview of methods that can be used to link ABC transporters to resistance. ABC proteins have also recently been implicated in the mode of action and resistance to Bt toxins in Lepidoptera. Given the enormous interest in Bt toxicology in transgenic crops, such findings will provide an impetus to further reveal the role of ABC transporters in arthropods.},

An over-expressed plasma membrane glycoprotein of relative molecular mass (Mr) 170,000 (P-glycoprotein) is consistently found in different multidrug-resistant human and animal cell lines, and in transplantable tumours. Consequently, it has been postulated that P-glycoprotein directly or indirectly mediates multidrug resistance. Here we report the cloning of a complementary DNA encoding P-glycoprotein.

	abstract = {P-Glycoprotein (P-gp) is a transmembrane protein, playing significant roles in the process of drug discovery and development and in pest resistance to pesticides. P-gp affects absorption, disposition, and elimination of different compounds and is mainly expressed in intestines, liver, kidneys, heart, colon, and placenta. The expression of P-gp in the blood-brain barrier (BBB) has been associated with the restricted access of many compounds to the central nervous system. Generated knockout mice by disruption of mdr 1a gene, encoding for P-gp, showed that this protein was expressed in the BBB. The absence or the low levels of P-gp elevated drug concentrations in tissues and decreased drug elimination. P-gp is responsible for resistance of cells to agents, particularly the anticancer drugs, by removing these drugs from cells. Increased expression of P-gp is implicated in decreased HIV drug availability at certain intracellular sites. The role of P-gp in affecting efficacy and toxicity of environmental toxicants such as pesticides and heavy metals has not been adequately investigated. Studies showed that P-gp contributes to resistance to pesticides in certain pest species, and to decrease toxicity by removing compounds from cells in mammals. Placental drug-transporting P-gp plays a significant role in limiting the transport of toxicants such as potential teratogens to the fetus. Several in vitro or in vivo assays, including using P-gp knockout or naturally deficient mice, were described for testing P-gp modulators. The role of P-gp following concurrent exposure to more multiple compounds needs further research. P-gp modulators should be carefully used, since some modulators that reverse P-gp efflux action in vitro may lead to alterations of tissue function and increase toxicity of xenobiotics in normal tissues. Recent reports from the pharmaceutical studies on the significance of P-gp as transporters in altering the efficacy and toxicity clearly highlight the need for further research in interaction with environmental toxicants.},

The aim of this work was to determine whether ouabain and other hypertrophic stimuli affect Na/K-ATPase beta1 subunit gene expression. When myocytes were exposed to non-toxic concentrations of ouabain, ouabain increased beta1 subunit mRNA in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Like the alpha3 gene, beta1 mRNA was also regulated by several other well-known hypertrophic stimuli including phenylephrine, a phorbol ester, endothelin-1, and insulin-like growth factor, suggesting involvement of growth signals in regulation of beta1 expression. Ouabain failed to increase beta1 subunit mRNA in the presence of actinomycin D. Using a luciferase reporter gene that is directed by the 5'-flanking region of the beta1 subunit gene, transient transfection assay showed that ouabain augmented the expression of luciferase. These data support the proposition that ouabain regulates the beta1 subunit through a transcriptional mechanism. The effect of ouabain on beta1 subunit induction, like that on alpha3 repression, was dependent on extracellular Ca2+ and on calmodulin. Inhibitions of PKC, Ras, and MEK, however, had different quantitive effects on ouabain-induced regulations of beta1 and alpha3 subunits. The findings show that partial inhibition of Na/K-ATPase activates multiple signaling pathways that regulate growth-related genes, including those of two subunit isoforms of Na/K-ATPase, in a gene-specific manner.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The hypothesis of this study is that the sodium pump complex acts as an intracellular signal-transducing molecule in canine vascular smooth muscle cells through its interaction with other membrane and cytoskeletal proteins. We have demonstrated that 1 nm ouabain induced transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), resulting in increased proliferation and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) uptake. Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting showed that the EGFR and Src were phosphorylated within 5 min of 10$^{\textrm{−9}}$m ouabain stimulation. Both ouabain-induced DNA synthesis (BrdUrd uptake) and MAPK42/44 phosphorylation were inhibited by the Src inhibitor PP2, the EGFR kinase inhibitor AG1478, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein, and the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059. Ouabain concentrations higher than 1 nm had little or no stimulating effect on proliferation or BrdUrd uptake but did minimally activate ERK1/2. Thus, low concentrations of ouabain, which do not inhibit the sodium pump sufficiently to perturb the resting cellular ionic milieu, initiate a transactivational signaling cascade leading to vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Downstream effects include NF-κB activation. Here we report that ankyrin B (Ank-B), expressed in most mammalian cells, plays a pivotal role in the function of the Na,K-ATPase/IP3R signaling microdomain. In studies performed on a monkey kidney cell line, we show that Ank-B co-precipitates with both Na,K-ATPase and IP3R. We identify the N terminus tail of the Na,K-ATPase catalytic subunit and the N-terminal portion 1-604 of the IP3R as novel binding sites for Ank-B. Knockdown of Ank-B with small interfering RNA reduced the expression of Ank-B to 15-30\%. This down-regulation of Ank-B attenuated the interaction between Na,K-ATPase and IP3R, reduced the number of cells responding to pm doses of ouabain with calcium oscillations, altered the calcium oscillatory pattern, and abolished the ouabain effect on NF-κB. In contrast, Ank-B down-regulation had no effect on the ion transporting function of Na,K-ATPase and no effect on the distribution and apparent mobility of Na,K-ATPase in the plasma membrane.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {ABSTRACTThe ion pump Na+, K+–ATPase (NKA) is a receptor for the cardiotonic steroid ouabain. Subsaturating concentration of ouabain triggers intracellular calcium oscillations, stimulates cell proliferation and adhesion, and protects from apoptosis. However, it is controversial whether ouabain-bound NKA is considered a signal transducer. To address this question, we performed a global analysis of protein phosphorylation in COS-7 cells, identifying 2580 regulated phosphorylation events on 1242 proteins upon 10- and 20-min treatment with ouabain. Regulated phosphorylated proteins include the inositol triphosphate receptor and stromal interaction molecule, which are essential for initiating calcium oscillations. Hierarchical clustering revealed that ouabain triggers a structured phosphorylation response that occurs in a well-defined, time-dependent manner and affects specific cellular processes, including cell proliferation and cell-cell junctions. We additionally identify regulation of the phosphorylation of several calcium and calmodulin–dependent protein kinases (CAMKs), including 2 sites of CAMK type II-γ (CAMK2G), a protein known to regulate apoptosis. To verify the significance of this result, CAMK2G was knocked down in primary kidney cells. CAMK2G knockdown impaired ouabain-dependent protection from apoptosis upon treatment with high glucose or serum deprivation. In conclusion, we establish NKA as the coordinator of a broad, tightly regulated phosphorylation response in cells and define CAMK2G as a downstream effector of NKA.—Panizza, E., Zhang, L., Fontana, J.

The goals of academic research have therefore expanded from target identification and validation to probe discovery, chemical genomics, and compound library screening. This trend is reflected in the emergence of HTS centers in the public domain over the past decade, ranging in size from modestly equipped academic screening centers to well endowed Molecular Libraries Probe Centers Network (MLPCN) centers funded by the NIH Roadmap initiative. These centers facilitate a comprehensive approach to probe discovery in academia and utilize both classical and cutting-edge assay technologies for executing primary and secondary screening campaigns. The various facets of academic HTS centers as well as their implications on technology transfer and drug discovery are discussed, and a roadmap for successful drug discovery in the public domain is presented. New lead discovery against therapeutic targets, especially those involving the rare and neglected diseases, is indeed a Mount Everestonian size task, and requires diligent implementation of pharmaceutical industry’s best practices for a successful outcome.},

They were initiated during the Serpukhovian Age as a response to lowering sea levels having exposed large areas of continental shelf. They expanded dramatically during the late Bashkirian Age, but then contracted by over one-half during the Kasimovian Age. The estimated loss of carbon sink probably resulted in an annual increase in atmospheric CO2 of about 2–5 ppm, and coincided with clear evidence of global warming in both the northern and southern high latitudes. A return to cooler conditions in very Early Permian times coincided with an expansion of the palaeotropical coal forests in the Far East, but this was short-lived and most of the rest of the Permian was a time of global warming. The Palaeozoic evidence clearly confirms that there is a correlation between levels of atmospheric CO2 and global climates. However, care must be taken in extrapolating this evidence to the present-day tropical forests, which do not act as a comparable unsaturated carbon sink.},

This review describes a number of fungal and bacterial organisms which have developed both competitive and mutualistic strategies for the decomposition of wood and to thrive in different ecological niches. Through the analysis of the enzymatic machinery engaged in wood degradation, it was possible to elucidate different strategies of wood decomposition which often depend on ecological niches inhabited by given organism. Moreover, a detailed description of low molecular weight compounds is presented, which gives these organisms not only an advantage in wood degradation processes, but seems rather to be a new evolutionatory alternative to enzymatic combustion. Through analysis of genomics and secretomic data, it was possible to underline the probable importance of certain wood-degrading enzymes produced by different fungal organisms, potentially giving them advantage in their ecological niches. The paper highlights different fungal strategies of wood degradation, which possibly correlates to the number of genes coding for secretory enzymes.

Their present-day diversity is the result of an evolutionary path that has involved the emergence of a multimodular architecture and further diversification of assembly-line PKSs. In this review, we provide an overview of previous studies that investigated PKS evolution and propose a model that challenges the currently prevailing view that gene duplication has played a major role in the emergence of multimodularity. We also analyze the ensemble of orphan PKS clusters sequenced so far to evaluate how large the entire diversity of assembly-line PKS clusters and their chemical products could be. Finally, we examine the existing techniques to access the natural PKS diversity in natural and heterologous hosts and describe approaches to further expand this diversity through engineering.},

They serve to attract pollinators, support secondary cell-wall growth, provide protection against various plant diseases, and interact with beneficial soil microbes. Their basic chemical properties also make them useful in the biofuel and biomaterial industries. Phenylpropanoid metabolism begins with the amino acid phenylalanine, which feeds into various biosynthetic pathways that generate a wide range of structurally related polyphenolic compounds. This review focuses on four sub-groups of these polyphenolic compounds - polyketides, stilbenes, isoflavones and catechins. We discuss the biosynthesis of these molecules, their physiological role in plants, and their striking pharmacological and physiological effects on humans. This review also highlights metabolic engineering efforts aimed at increasing or decreasing the amounts of each class of compound in various model plants and crops.},

	abstract = {Present review provides a thorough insight on some significant aspects of CHSs over a period of about past three decades with a better outlook for future studies toward comprehending the structural and mechanistic intricacy of this symbolic enzyme. Polyketide synthases (PKSs) form a large family of iteratively acting multifunctional proteins that are involved in the biosynthesis of spectrum of natural products. They exhibit remarkable versatility in the structural configuration and functional organization with an incredible ability to generate different classes of compounds other than the characteristic secondary metabolite constituents. Architecturally, chalcone synthase (CHS) is considered to be the simplest representative of Type III PKSs. The enzyme is pivotal for phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and is also well known for catalyzing the initial step of the flavonoid/isoflavonoid pathway. Being the first Type III enzyme to be discovered, CHS has been subjected to ample investigations which, to a greater extent, have tried to understand its structural complexity and promiscuous functional behavior. In this context, we vehemently tried to collect the fragmented information entirely focussed on this symbolic enzyme from about past three-four decades. The aim of this review is to selectively summarize data on some of the fundamental aspects of CHSs viz, its history and distribution, localization, structure and analogs in non-plant hosts, promoter analyses, and role in defense, with an emphasis on mechanistic studies in different species and vis-à-vis mutation-led changes, and evolutionary significance which has been discussed in detail. The present review gives an insight with a better perspective for the scientific community for future studies devoted towards delimiting the mechanistic and structural basis of polyketide biosynthetic machinery vis-à-vis CHS.},

Erythromycin A, a macrolide antibacterial, has been in clinical usage for 53 years, while its semisynthetic derivative azithromycin (Zithromax) is one of the best-selling antibiotics in the world. The enediynes, relative newcomers to the polyketide stage, are among the most powerful anticancer agents yet discovered. More than a third of natural product and natural product-derived compounds approved as drugs in the 2005–2007 period were polyketides, while a host of others are advancing through clinical trials. As testimony to their importance, annual sales of polyketide-derived medicines routinely top US\$20 billion. The endless variety of polyketide shape and structure continues to fascinate synthetic and natural product chemists alike. However, the biochemical basis for programming alternative modes of polyketide construction to yield polyketones, partially reduced polyketides or fully reduced fatty acids, remained obscure; no obvious mechanism was available to explain the choice or number of building blocks and the order in which they are incorporated, the extent of redox adjustment following each round of chain extension, and the pattern of cyclization or lactonization of the resulting chains. The answer to this conundrum has emerged over several decades through sequencing and biochemical studies of hundreds of genes encoding for polyketide synthases (PKSs) and associated decorating enzymes; conveniently, these biosynthetic genes are often clustered together within the genomes of the producing organisms.},

The crystal structures of CHS alone and complexed with substrate and product analogs reveal the active site architecture that defines the sequence and chemistry of multiple decarboxylation and condensation reactions and provides a molecular understanding of the cyclization reaction leading to chalcone synthesis. The structure of CHS complexed with resveratrol also suggests how stilbene synthase, a related enzyme, uses the same substrates and an alternate cyclization pathway to form resveratrol. By using the three-dimensional structure and the large database of CHS-like sequences, we can identify proteins likely to possess novel substrate and product specificity.

Crystallographic and functional studies of chalcone synthase (CHS), a plant-specific PKS, indicate that a cysteine-histidine pair (Cys$^{\textrm{164}}$-His$^{\textrm{303}}$) forms part of the catalytic machinery. Thiol-specific inactivation and the pH dependence of the malonyl-CoA decarboxylation reaction were used to evaluate the potential interaction between these two residues. Inactivation of CHS by iodoacetamide and iodoacetic acid targets Cys$^{\textrm{164}}$ in a pH-dependent manner (p\textit{K}$_{\textrm{a}}$ = 5.50). The acidic p\textit{K}$_{\textrm{a}}$ of Cys$^{\textrm{164}}$ suggests that an ionic interaction with His$^{\textrm{303}}$ stabilizes the thiolate anion. Consistent with this assertion, substitution of a glutamine for His$^{\textrm{303}}$ maintains catalytic activity but shifts the p\textit{K}$_{\textrm{a}}$ of the thiol to 6.61. Although the H303A mutant was catalytically inactive, the pH-dependent incorporation of [$^{\textrm{14}}$C]iodoacetamide into this mutant exhibits a p\textit{K}$_{\textrm{a}}$ = 7.62. Subsequent analysis of the pH dependence of the malonyl-CoA decarboxylation reaction catalyzed by wild-type CHS and the H303Q and C164A mutants also supports the presence of an ion pair at the CHS active site. Structural and sequence conservation of a cysteine-histidine pair in the active sites of other PKS implies that a thiolate-imidazolium ion pair plays a central role in polyketide biosynthesis.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Protein cross-linking and site-directed mutagenesis identified a subunit contact site in position 158, close to the active site (Cys$^{\textrm{169}}$). This suggested that the active site pockets may be neighboring, possibly alternating in the condensing reactions rather than acting independently. This was investigated by co-expression of active site mutants with differently mutated, inactive proteins. With both STS and CHS, the heterodimers synthesized the end products, indicating that each subunit performed all three condensations. In co-action with a monomeric reductase, CHS also synthesizes 6′-deoxychalcone, but with the chalcone as second product when using plant preparations. The two enzymes expressed as single species in \textit{Escherichia coli} synthesized both products, and both were also obtained with a CHS heterodimer containing a single active site. The results showed that 6′-deoxychalcone synthesis required no other plant factor and that the formation of two products may be an intrinsic property of the interaction between dimeric CHS and monomeric reductase.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {ALTHOUGH phytoalexins1,2 have long been inferred to be important in the defence of plants against fungal infection1,2, there are few reports showing that they provide resistance to infection. Several plants, including grapevine, synthesize the stilbene-type phytoalexin resveratrol3–7 when attacked by pathogens. Stilbenes with fungicidal potential are formed in several unrelated plant species, such as peanut (Arachis hypogaea), grapevine (Vitis vinifera) and pine (Pinus sylvestris)3,5,11–15. Stilbene biosynthesis only specifically requires the presence of stilbene synthase6,9. Furthermore, the precursor molecules for the formation of hydroxy-stilbenes are malonyl-CoA and p-coumaroyl-CoA, both present in plants9. To investigate the potential of stilbene biosynthetic genes in a strategy of engineering pathogen resistance, we isolated stilbene synthase genes from grapevine, where they are expressed at a high level, and transferred them into tobacco10. We report here that regenerated tobacco plants containing these genes are more resistant to infection by Botrytis cinerea. This is, to our knowledge, the first report of increased disease resistance in transgenic plants based on an additional foreign phytoalexin.},

A broader perspective is achieved by a comparison of these CHS-like enzymes to mechanistically and evolutionarily related families of enzymes, including the type I and type II PKSs, as well as the thiolases and β-ketoacyl synthases of fatty acid metabolism. As CHS is both the most frequently occurring and best studied type III PKS, this enzyme's structure and mechanism is examined in detail. The in vivo functions and biological activities of several classes of plant natural products derived from chalcones are also discussed. Evolutionary mechanisms of type III PKS divergence are considered, as are the biological functions and activities of each of the known and functionally divergent type III PKS enzyme families (currently twelve in plants and three in bacteria). A major focus of this review is the integration of information from genetic and biochemical studies with the unique insights gained from protein X-ray crystallography and homology modeling. This structural approach has generated a number of new predictions regarding both the importance and mechanistic role of various amino acid substitutions observed among functionally diverse type III PKS enzymes.},

	abstract = {Several years of extensive research using the new powerful techniques of molecular biology have enabled the direct comparison of functionally or evolutionarily related genes and their products at the nucleotide and amino acid sequence levels. Two types of synthase with similar functions are discussed as an interesting example. Stilbene synthases, e.g. resveratrol synthase, produce the stilbene backbone as a key reaction in the biosynthesis of stilbene-type phytoalexins. Chalcone synthase is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of flavonoids, including certain phytoalexins derived from a 6'-deoxychalcone which is synthesized by cooperation of chalcone synthase with a reductase. Resveratrol and chalcone synthases utilize the same substrates (4-coumaroyl-CoA and 3 molecules of malonyl-CoA) and catalyze the same condensing type of enzyme reaction (resulting in sequential addition of acetate units via malonyl-CoA), but the products differ in the newly formed ring systems (resveratrol and naringenin chalcone). A comparative analysis of cloned DNA sequences and of the reaction mechanisms indicates that the two enzymes are closely related. It seems likely that the proteins possess a common scaffold for substrate recognition and for the condensing reaction, and that the different folding of an enzyme-bound intermediate prior to closure of the new aromatic ring is responsible for the formation of the different products. The same type of condensing reaction is utilized by the 2-ketoacyl-ACP synthases of fatty-acid biosynthesis. However, the available data indicate that these enzymes share little overall homology with either resveratrol or chalcone synthase. One exception may be a short amino acid sequence which corresponds to the active center of the condensing reaction in 2-ketoacyl-ACP synthases.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Polyketide synthases (PKSs) generate molecular diversity by utilizing different starter molecules and by controlling the final length of the polyketide. Although exploitation of this mechanistic variability has produced novel polyketides, the structural foundation of this versatility is unclear. Plant-specific PKSs are essential for the biosynthesis of anti-microbial phytoalexins, anthocyanin floral pigments, and inducers of Rhizobium nodulation genes. 2-Pyrone synthase (2-PS) and chalcone synthase (CHS) are plant-specific PKSs that share 74\% amino acid sequence identity. 2-PS forms the triketide methylpyrone from an acetyl-CoA starter molecule and two malonyl-CoAs. CHS uses a p-coumaroyl-CoA starter molecule and three malonyl-CoAs to produce the tetraketide chalcone. Our goal was to elucidate the molecular basis of starter molecule selectivity and control of polyketide length in this class of PKS.
RESULTS: The 2.05 A resolution crystal structure of 2-PS complexed with the reaction intermediate acetoacetyl-CoA was determined by molecular replacement. 2-PS and CHS share a common three-dimensional fold, a set of conserved catalytic residues, and similar CoA binding sites. However, the active site cavity of 2-PS is smaller than the cavity in CHS. Of the 28 residues lining the 2-PS initiation/elongation cavity, four positions vary in CHS. Point mutations at three of these positions in CHS (T197L, G256L, and S338I) altered product formation. Combining these mutations in a CHS triple mutant (T197L/G256L/S338I) yielded an enzyme that was functionally identical to 2-PS.
CONCLUSIONS: Structural and functional characterization of 2-PS together with generation of a CHS mutant with an initiation/elongation cavity analogous to 2-PS demonstrates that cavity volume influences the choice of starter molecule and controls the final length of the polyketide. These results provide a structural basis for control of polyketide length in other PKSs, and suggest strategies for further increasing the scope of polyketide biosynthetic diversity.},

The stepwise condensing reactions correspond to those in other polyketide and fatty-acid synthases. This predicts that the two proteins also contain cysteines that are essential for enzyme activity because they bind the substrates. We exchanged, in both enzymes, all of the 6 conserved cysteines into alanine by site-directed mutagenesis and tested the mutants after expression of the proteins in the Escherichia coli heterologous system. Only cysteine 169 was essential in both enzymes, and inhibitor studies suggest that it is the main target of cerulenin, an antibiotic reacting with the cysteine in the active center of condensing enzymes. Most of the other exchanges led to reduced activities. In two cases, the enzymes responded differently, suggesting that the cysteines at positions 135 and 195 may be involved in the different product specificity of the two enzymes. The sequences surrounding the essential cysteine 169 revealed no similarity to the active sites of condensing enzymes in other polyketide synthases and in fatty acid biosynthesis.

Anthocyanins responsible for the colors, red, purple, and blue, are in fruits and vegetables. Berries, currants, grapes, and some tropical fruits have high anthocyanins content. Red to purplish blue-colored leafy vegetables, grains, roots, and tubers are the edible vegetables that contain a high level of anthocyanins. Among the anthocyanin pigments, cyanidin-3-glucoside is the major anthocyanin found in most of the plants. The colored anthocyanin pigments have been traditionally used as a natural food colorant. The color and stability of these pigments are influenced by pH, light, temperature, and structure. In acidic condition, anthocyanins appear as red but turn blue when the pH increases. Chromatography has been largely applied in extraction, separation, and quantification of anthocyanins. Besides the use of anthocyanidins and anthocyanins as natural dyes, these colored pigments are potential pharmaceutical ingredients that give various beneficial health effects. Scientific studies, such as cell culture studies, animal models, and human clinical trials, show that anthocyanidins and anthocyanins possess antioxidative and antimicrobial activities, improve visual and neurological health, and protect against various non-communicable diseases. These studies confer the health effects of anthocyanidins and anthocyanins, which are due to their potent antioxidant properties. Different mechanisms and pathways are involved in the protective effects, including free-radical scavenging pathway, cyclooxygenase pathway, mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, and inflammatory cytokines signaling.

The mutagenicity of 0.05 nmol of B[a]P 7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide-2 in strain TA100 of Salmonella typhimurium is inhibited 50\% by incubation of the bacteria and the diol epoxide with 150 nmol of ferulic acid, 75 nmol of caffeic acid, 50 nmol of chlorogenic acid or, most strikingly, 1 nmol of ellagic acid in the 0.5-ml incubation mixture. A 3-nmol dose of ellagic acid inhibits mutation induction by 90\%. Ellagic acid is also a potent antagonist of B[a]P 7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide-2 in Chinese hamster V79 cells. Mutations to 8-azaguanine resistance induced by 0.2 muM diol epoxide are reduced by 50\% when tissue culture media also contains 2 muM ellagic acid. Similar to results obtained with the bacteria, ferulic, caffeic, and chlorogenic acids are approximately two orders of magnitude less active than ellagic acid in the mammalian cell assay. The antimutagenic effects of the plant phenols result from their direct interaction with B[a]P 7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide-2, because a concentration-dependent increase in the rate of diol epoxide disappearance in cell-free solutions of 1:9 dioxane/water, pH 7.0, is observed with all four phenols. In parallel with the mutagenicity studies, ellagic acid is 80-300 times more effective than the other phenols in accelerating the disappearance of B[a]P 7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide-2. Ellagic acid at 10 muM increases the disappearance of B[a]P 7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide-2 by approximately 20-fold relative to the spontaneous and hydronium ion-catalyzed hydrolysis of the diol epoxide at pH 7.0. Ellagic acid is a highly potent inhibitor of the mutagenic activity of bay-region diol epoxides of benzo[a]pyrene, dibenzo[a,h]pyrene, and dibenzo[a,i]pyrene, but higher concentrations of ellagic acid are needed to inhibit the mutagenic activity of the chemically less reactive bay-region diol epoxides of benz[a]anthracene, chrysene, and benzo[c]phenanthrene. These studies demonstrate that ellagic acid is a potent antagonist of the adverse biological effects of the ultimate carcinogenic metabolites of several polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and suggest that this naturally occurring plant phenol, normally ingested by humans, may inhibit the carcinogenicity of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.},

	abstract = {A novel coronavirus responsible of acute respiratory infection closely related to SARS-CoV has recently emerged. So far there is no consensus for drug treatment to stop the spread of the virus. Discovery of a drug that would limit the virus expansion is one of the biggest challenges faced by the humanity in the last decades. In this perspective, to test existing drugs as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main protease is a good approach. Among natural phenolic compounds found in plants, fruit, and vegetables; flavonoids are the most abundant. Flavonoids, especially in their glycosylated forms, display a number of physiological activities, which makes them interesting to investigate as antiviral molecules. The flavonoids chemical structures were downloaded from PubChem and protease structure 6LU7 was from the Protein Data Bank site. Molecular docking study was performed using AutoDock Vina. Among the tested molecules Quercetin-3-O-rhamnoside showed the highest binding affinity (-9,7 kcal/mol). Docking studies showed that glycosylated flavonoids are good inhibitors for the SARS-CoV-2 protease and could be further investigated by in vitro and in vivo experiments for further validation. MD simulations were further performed to evaluate the dynamic behavior and stability of the protein in complex with the three best hits of docking experiments. Our results indicate that the rutin is a potential drug to inhibit the function of Chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL pro) of Coronavirus.},

However, experimental evidence for an antioxidant function in plants is limited to a few individual flavonoids under very specific experimental and developmental conditions. As we discuss here, although flavonoids have been demonstrated to accumulate with oxidative stress during abiotic and biotic environmental assaults, a convincing spatio-temporal correlation with the flavonoid oxidation products is not yet available. Thereby, the widely accepted antioxidant function of flavonoids in plants is still a matter of debate.},

	abstract = {The reduced polyketides are a medicinally important group of metabolites, which are assembled in bacteria on gigantic multienzyme polyketide synthases (PKSs). These PKSs typically contain a single enzymatic domain for each step in polyketide construction, and so appear to be 'modular', on the genetic level at least.The division-of-labour organization of the PKSs suggests that they might be genetically engineered to produce polyketide analogues, with potential as drug candidates. The idea of rearranging PKS components in as many ways as possible to generate large libraries of new compounds is known as 'combinatorial biosynthesis'.Although genetic engineering has been shown repeatedly to work in practice, generating over 200 novel structures, many experiments produce low yields of the expected novel polyketides, or fail entirely. The goal of truly combinatorial engineering, though theoretically achievable, remains distant.Therefore, a central goal in the field is to obtain a significantly deeper understanding of the operation and three-dimensional architecture of the PKSs to increase the efficiency of engineering experiments. Sequencing of additional gene clusters has revealed that PKSs are far more diverse and complex than initially appreciated.Other important research areas include developing heterologous hosts for polyketide production, which are capable of post-translational modification of PKS proteins and which contain all of the necessary small-molecule precursors; improving the genetic tools required to manipulate and transfer large PKS genes and gene clusters; and identifying PKS domains and post-PKS tailoring enzymes which are inherently suited to combinatorial applications, due to their relaxed substrate specificities.Significant progress has been made in all of these areas; of particular note are the first high-resolution structures of individual PKS components and the metabolic engineering of E. coli for polyketide production. Advances in engineering strategies have also resulted in a biological route to the important antiparasitic agent ivermectin.},

Analysis of the aqueous extracts of the leaves of the host. Asimina triloba, showed that they contained stimulant 1, its isomer (2), and the flavonoids rutin (3) and nicotiflorine (4) as major components. We compared the concentrations of compounds 1-4 in terminal leaves (TL) and expanded leaves (EL) of the host plants at four different times throughout the growing season. In spring, the concentration of 1 was highest in TLs, and flavonoids were not detectable or present at low levels. As the season progressed, however, the concentrations of flavonoids increased, reached maxima by late summer, and then decreased as the plants started senescing. There were also significant differences in the concentrations of these compounds between TLs and ELs. In a choice assay with model leaves, we tested equivalent amounts of post-dichloromethane aqueous extracts made in spring (May) and in fall (September). September extracts received significantly fewer approaches and eggs. In greenhouse experiments with potted A. triloba plants, the butterflies chose some leaves to lay eggs, while others were rejected or ignored. Analyses showed that the concentrations of compound 1 were not significantly different in the three kinds of leaves. The flavonoids (3 and 4), however, were significantly higher in the leaves that were ignored. Multiple-choice tests using model plants suggested that concentrations of both flavonoids and stimulant were important in assessing host suitability. There was a gradual decrease in approaches as the concentration of 1 decreased. Higher amounts of flavonoids deterred egg laying even in the presence of high concentrations of stimulant 1. At lower concentrations of 1, the addition of low doses of flavonoids deterred egg laying. Thus, the results suggest that the butterflies use both qualitative and quantitative information about these compounds to assess host quality. This behavior may have evolved to take advantage of seasonal variation in the chemistry of their host, A. triloba.},

The paw paw is a small tree native to eastern North America; its edible fruits (sometimes referred to as “Indiana Bananas”) have nurtured mankind for centuries. Activity-directed fractionation of the paw paw extracts, using the brine shrimp lethality bioassay, led to the isolation and molecular characterization of over 50 unique annonaceous acetogenins. Fractionation of extracts from related species resulted in the identification of over 150 additional acetogenins. The annonaceous acetogenins are derivatives of long-chain (C32 or C34) fatty acids. They are potent inhibitors of mitochondrial (complex I) as well as cytoplasmic (anaerobic) production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and the related nucleotides. The powerful cytotoxicity, in vivo antitumor, pesticidal, antimalarial, anthelmintic, piscicidal, antiviral, and antimicrobial effects indicated a myriad of potentially useful applications. Commercial development of these compounds uses natural mixtures of active components, incorporated into pesticidal, topical, and dietary supplement products. Successful applications and commercial products include a shampoo, highly effective in treating infestations of head lice, fleas, and ticks; a series of pesticidal sprays, which protects host plants against a diversity of pests; and an ointment for treatment of oral herpes (HSV-1) and other skin afflictions. The extract (in capsule form) enhances a mixture of natural anthelmintics. In addition, an encapsulated extract has been effectively used by certain cancer patients as a botanical supplement product.},

Our aim was to study structural influences, like basic structure, number of hydroxyl groups and number of Bors criteria on the outcome of the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay. Furthermore, similarities and differences to other in vitro antioxidant assays were analyzed by principal component analysis. Our studies confirmed that the antioxidant behavior in the ORAC assay is dominated by the number and types of substituents and not by the Bors criteria, as long as no steric hindrance occurs. For example, morin (MOR) with five hydroxyl groups and two Bors criteria reached an area under the curve of (3.64 ± 0.08) × 105, which was significantly higher than quercetin-7-D-glucoside (QGU7) (P {\textless} 0.001), and thus the highest result. Principal component analysis showed different dependencies regarding structural properties of Folin-Ciocalteu (FC)- and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH)-assays or 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS)- and ORAC-assays, respectively. Therefore, we conclude that they are based on different reaction mechanisms. The number of hydroxyl groups showed a stronger influence on the antioxidant activity than the Bors criteria. Due to these differences, the correlation of these rapid tests to specific applications should be validated.},

Most of the foods were collected from four different regions and during two different seasons in U.S. markets. Total phenolics of each sample were also measured using the Folin−Ciocalteu reagent. Hydrophilic ORACFL values (H-ORACFL) ranged from 0.87 to 2641 μmol of Trolox equivalents (TE)/g among all of the foods, whereas lipophilic ORACFL values (L-ORACFL) ranged from 0.07 to 1611 μmol of TE/g. Generally, L-ORACFL values were {\textless}10\% of the H-ORACFL values except for a very few samples. Total antioxidant capacity was calculated by combining L-ORACFL and H-ORACFL. Differences of ORACFL values in fruits and vegetables from different seasons and regions were relatively large for some foods but could not be analyzed in detail because of the sampling scheme. Two different processing methods, cooking and peeling, were used on selected foods to evaluate the impact of processing on ORACFL. The data demonstrated that processing can have significant effects on ORACFL. Considering all of the foods analyzed, the relationship between TP and H-ORACFL showed a very weak correlation. Total hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidant capacity intakes were calculated to be 5558 and 166 μmol of TE/day, respectively, on the basis of data from the USDA Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals (1994−1996).

	abstract = {Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS, e.g. nitric oxide, NO(*)) are well recognised for playing a dual role as both deleterious and beneficial species. ROS and RNS are normally generated by tightly regulated enzymes, such as NO synthase (NOS) and NAD(P)H oxidase isoforms, respectively. Overproduction of ROS (arising either from mitochondrial electron-transport chain or excessive stimulation of NAD(P)H) results in oxidative stress, a deleterious process that can be an important mediator of damage to cell structures, including lipids and membranes, proteins, and DNA. In contrast, beneficial effects of ROS/RNS (e.g. superoxide radical and nitric oxide) occur at low/moderate concentrations and involve physiological roles in cellular responses to noxia, as for example in defence against infectious agents, in the function of a number of cellular signalling pathways, and the induction of a mitogenic response. Ironically, various ROS-mediated actions in fact protect cells against ROS-induced oxidative stress and re-establish or maintain "redox balance" termed also "redox homeostasis". The "two-faced" character of ROS is clearly substantiated. For example, a growing body of evidence shows that ROS within cells act as secondary messengers in intracellular signalling cascades which induce and maintain the oncogenic phenotype of cancer cells, however, ROS can also induce cellular senescence and apoptosis and can therefore function as anti-tumourigenic species. This review will describe the: (i) chemistry and biochemistry of ROS/RNS and sources of free radical generation; (ii) damage to DNA, to proteins, and to lipids by free radicals; (iii) role of antioxidants (e.g. glutathione) in the maintenance of cellular "redox homeostasis"; (iv) overview of ROS-induced signaling pathways; (v) role of ROS in redox regulation of normal physiological functions, as well as (vi) role of ROS in pathophysiological implications of altered redox regulation (human diseases and ageing). Attention is focussed on the ROS/RNS-linked pathogenesis of cancer, cardiovascular disease, atherosclerosis, hypertension, ischemia/reperfusion injury, diabetes mellitus, neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease), rheumatoid arthritis, and ageing. Topics of current debate are also reviewed such as the question whether excessive formation of free radicals is a primary cause or a downstream consequence of tissue injury.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The General Population Nutrition Intervention Trial was a randomized primary esophageal and gastric cancer prevention trial conducted from 1985 to 1991, in which 29,584 adult participants in Linxian, China, were given daily vitamin and mineral supplements. Treatment with "factor D," a combination of 50 microg selenium, 30 mg vitamin E, and 15 mg beta-carotene, led to decreased mortality from all causes, cancer overall, and gastric cancer. Here, we present 10-year follow-up after the end of active intervention.
METHODS: Participants were assessed by periodic data collection, monthly visits by village health workers, and quarterly review of the Linxian Cancer Registry. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for the cumulative effects of four vitamin and mineral supplementation regimens were calculated using adjusted proportional hazards models.
RESULTS: Through May 31, 2001, 276 participants were lost to follow-up; 9727 died, including 3242 from cancer (1515 from esophageal cancer and 1199 from gastric cancer). Participants who received factor D had lower overall mortality (HR = 0.95, 95\% CI = 0.91 to 0.99; P = .009; reduction in cumulative mortality from 33.62\% to 32.19\%) and gastric cancer mortality (HR = 0.89, 95\% CI = 0.79 to 1.00; P = .043; reduction in cumulative gastric cancer mortality from 4.28\% to 3.84\%) than subjects who did not receive factor D. Reductions were mostly attributable to benefits to subjects younger than 55 years. Esophageal cancer deaths between those who did and did not receive factor D were not different overall; however, decreased 17\% among participants younger than 55 (HR = 0.83, 95\% CI = 0.71 to 0.98; P = .025) but increased 14\% among those aged 55 years or older (HR = 1.14, 95\% CI = 1.00 to 1.30; P = .047) [corrected]. Vitamin A and zinc supplementation was associated with increased total and stroke mortality; vitamin C and molybdenum supplementation, with decreased stroke mortality.
CONCLUSION: The beneficial effects of selenium, vitamin E, and beta-carotene on mortality were still evident up to 10 years after the cessation of supplementation and were consistently greater in younger participants. Late effects of other supplementation regimens were also observed.},

PURPOSE: To systematically review evidence for the benefit and harms of vitamin and mineral supplements in community-dwelling, nutrient-sufficient adults for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer.
DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects were searched from January 2005 to 29 January 2013, with manual searches of reference lists and gray literature.
STUDY SELECTION: Two investigators independently selected and reviewed fair- and good-quality trials for benefit and fair- and good-quality trials and observational studies for harms.
DATA EXTRACTION: Dual quality assessments and data abstraction.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Two large trials (n = 27 658) reported lower cancer incidence in men taking a multivitamin for more than 10 years (pooled unadjusted relative risk, 0.93 [95\% CI, 0.87 to 0.99]). The study that included women showed no effect in that group. High-quality studies (k = 24; n = 324 653) of single and paired nutrients (such as vitamins A, C, or D; folic acid; selenium; or calcium) were scant and heterogeneous and showed no clear evidence of benefit or harm. Neither vitamin E nor β-carotene prevented CVD or cancer, and β-carotene increased lung cancer risk in smokers.
LIMITATIONS: The analysis included only primary prevention studies in adults without known nutritional deficiencies. Studies were conducted in older individuals and included various supplements and doses under the set upper tolerable limits. Duration of most studies was less than 10 years.
CONCLUSION: Limited evidence supports any benefit from vitamin and mineral supplementation for the prevention of cancer or CVD. Two trials found a small, borderline-significant benefit from multivitamin supplements on cancer in men only and no effect on CVD.

	abstract = {At high concentrations, free radicals and radical-derived, nonradical reactive species are hazardous for living organisms and damage all major cellular constituents. At moderate concentrations, however, nitric oxide (NO), superoxide anion, and related reactive oxygen species (ROS) play an important role as regulatory mediators in signaling processes. Many of the ROS-mediated responses actually protect the cells against oxidative stress and reestablish "redox homeostasis." Higher organisms, however, have evolved the use of NO and ROS also as signaling molecules for other physiological functions. These include regulation of vascular tone, monitoring of oxygen tension in the control of ventilation and erythropoietin production, and signal transduction from membrane receptors in various physiological processes. NO and ROS are typically generated in these cases by tightly regulated enzymes such as NO synthase (NOS) and NAD(P)H oxidase isoforms, respectively. In a given signaling protein, oxidative attack induces either a loss of function, a gain of function, or a switch to a different function. Excessive amounts of ROS may arise either from excessive stimulation of NAD(P)H oxidases or from less well-regulated sources such as the mitochondrial electron-transport chain. In mitochondria, ROS are generated as undesirable side products of the oxidative energy metabolism. An excessive and/or sustained increase in ROS production has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cancer, diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis, neurodegenerative diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, ischemia/reperfusion injury, obstructive sleep apnea, and other diseases. In addition, free radicals have been implicated in the mechanism of senescence. That the process of aging may result, at least in part, from radical-mediated oxidative damage was proposed more than 40 years ago by Harman (J Gerontol 11: 298-300, 1956). There is growing evidence that aging involves, in addition, progressive changes in free radical-mediated regulatory processes that result in altered gene expression.},

	abstract = {The most important electron acceptor in the biosphere is molecular oxygen which, by virtue of its bi-radical nature, readily accepts unpaired electrons to give rise to a series of partially reduced species collectively known as reduced (or 'reactive') oxygen species (ROS). These include superoxide (O.2-), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydroxyl radical (HO.) and peroxyl (ROO.) and alkoxyl (RO.) radicals which may be involved in the initiation and propagation of free radical chain reactions and which are potentially highly damaging to cells. Mechanisms have evolved to restrict and control such processes, partly by compartmentation, and partly by antioxidant defences such as chain-breaking antioxidant compounds capable forming stable free radicals (e.g. ascorbate, alpha-tocopherol) and the evolution of enzyme systems (e.g. superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidases) that diminish the intracellular concentration of the ROS. Although some ROS perform useful functions, the production of ROS exceeding the ability of the organism to mount an antioxidant defence results in oxidative stress and the ensuing tissue damage may be involved in certain disease processes. Evidence that ROS are involved in primary pathological mechanisms is a feature mainly of extraneous physical or chemical perturbations of which radiation is perhaps the major contributor. One of the important radiation-induced free-radical species is the hydroxyl radical which indiscriminately attacks neighbouring molecules often at near diffusion-controlled rates. Hydroxyl radicals are generated by ionizing radiation either directly by oxidation of water, or indirectly by the formation of secondary partially ROS. These may be subsequently converted to hydroxyl radicals by further reduction ('activation') by metabolic processes in the cell. Secondary radiation injury is therefore influenced by the cellular antioxidant status and the amount and availability of activating mechanisms. The biological response to radiation may be modulated by alterations in factors affecting these secondary mechanisms of cellular injury.},

In general, highly reactive oxygen-bearing molecules remain the backbone of diverse ground-breaking technologies, driving the waves of scientific development in environmental, biotechnology, materials, medical and defence sciences. Singlet oxygen has a relatively high energy of about 94 kJ/mol compared to the ground state molecular O2 and therefore initiates low-temperature oxidation of electron-rich hydrocarbons. Such reactivity of singlet oxygen has inspired a wide array of emerging applications in chemical, biochemical and combustion phenomena. This paper reviews the intrinsic properties of singlet oxygen, emphasising the physical aspects of its natural occurrences, production techniques, as well as chemical reactivity with organic fuels and contaminants. The review assembles critical scientific studies on the implications of singlet oxygen in initiating chemical reactions, identifying, and quantitating the consequential effects on combustion, fire safety, as well as on the low-temperature treatment of organic wastes and contaminants. Moreover, the content of this review appraises computational efforts, such as DFT quantum mechanical modelling, in developing mechanistic (i. e., both thermodynamic and kinetic) insights into the reaction of singlet oxygen with hydrocarbons.},

The paper first describes the electronic structure of oxygen and of two low-lying electronically excited states. Concern with the low-lying electronically excited states is no longer the sole property of spectroscopists; recently, evidence has been presented for the participation of such activated molecules in chemical reactions. The chemistry of oxygen is dominated by the fact that the molecule in the ground state has two unpaired electrons, whereas the products of oxidation in many important reactions have zero spin. In its reactions with transition metal ions the restrictions imposed by the spin state of the oxygen molecule are easily circumvented. A number of reactions of oxygen with metal ions have been studied in considerable detail; conclusions on basic aspects of the reaction mechanism are outlined. Among the most interesting reactions of oxygen are those in which it is reversibly absorbed by reducing agents. Reversible absorption to form a peroxide in the bound state is possible; some of the conditions which must be fulfilled by a reducing system to qualify as storing oxygen in this way are reasonably well understood and are here enunciated. Little has been done on the formation of oxygen from water; some factors involved in this process are discussed.},

	abstract = {Ionizing radiation-induced bystander effects, commonly observed in cell populations exposed to high-linear energy transfer (LET) radiations, are initiated by damage to a cellular molecule which then gives rise to a toxic signal exported to neighboring cells not directly hit by radiation. A major goal in studies of this phenomenon is the identification of this initial radiation-induced lesion. Liquid water being the main constituent of biological matter, reactive species produced by water radiolysis in the cellular environment are likely to be major contributors to the induction of this lesion. In this context, the radiation track structure is of crucial importance in specifying the precise location and identity of all the radiolytic species and their subsequent signaling or damaging effects. We report here Monte Carlo track structure simulations of the radiolysis of liquid water by four different impacting ions 1H+, 4He2+, 12C6+ and 20Ne10+, with the same LET ( approximately 70 keV/ microm). The initial radial distribution profiles of the various water decomposition products (eaq(-), *OH, H*, H2 and H2O2) for the different ions considered are presented and discussed briefly in the context of track structure theory. As an example, the formation and temporal evolution of simulated 24 MeV 4He2+ ion tracks (LET approximately 26 keV/microm) are reported for each radiolytic species from 1 ps to 10 micros. The calculations reveal that the ion track structure is completely lost by approximately 1 micros.},

	abstract = {Data have been emerging over the past two decades concerning two phenomena in which important biological effects of ionizing radiation arise in cells that in themselves receive no radiation exposure. In the first, radiation-induced genomic instability, biological effects occur in the progeny of the irradiated cell after many generations of cell division. In the second, radiation-induced bystander effects, they arise in cells that receive no radiation exposure as a consequence of damage signals transmitted from neighboring irradiated cells; transmission may be mediated either by direct intercellular communication through gap junctions, or by factors released into the surrounding medium. In both phenomena, the biological effects appear to be associated with an upregulation of oxidative metabolism. The present paper is designed to review the historical background leading to our current knowledge of these two phenomena, and to indicate some future directions for research that will allow us to assess better their importance in the health effects of exposure to ionizing radiation.},

These include radiation-induced genomic instability, death-inducing and bystander effects, clastogenic factors and transgenerational effects. It is unlikely that these nontargeted effects are directly induced by cellular irradiation. Instead, it is proposed that some as yet to be identified secreted factor can be produced by irradiated cells that can stimulate effects in nonirradiated cells (death-inducing and bystander effects, clastogenic factors) and perpetuate genomic instability in the clonally expanded progeny of an irradiated cell. The proposed factor must be soluble and capable of being transported between cells by cell-to-cell gap junction communication channels. Furthermore, it must have the potential to stimulate cellular cytokines and/or reactive oxygen species. While it is difficult to imagine a role for such a secreted factor in contributing to transgenerational effects, the other nontargeted effects of radiation may all share a common mechanism.},

	abstract = {Ever since x-rays were shown to induce mutation in Drosophila more than 70 years ago, prevailing dogma considered the genotoxic effects of ionizing radiation, such as mutations and carcinogenesis, as being due mostly to direct damage to the nucleus. Although there was indication that alpha particle traversal through cellular cytoplasm was innocuous, the full impact remained unknown. The availability of the microbeam at the Radiological Research Accelerator Facility of Columbia University made it possible to target and irradiate the cytoplasm of individual cells in a highly localized spatial region. By using dual fluorochrome dyes (Hoechst and Nile Red) to locate nucleus and cellular cytoplasm, respectively, thereby avoiding inadvertent traversal of nuclei, we show here that cytoplasmic irradiation is mutagenic at the CD59 (S1) locus of human–hamster hybrid (AL) cells, while inflicting minimal cytotoxicity. The principal class of mutations induced are similar to those of spontaneous origin and are entirely different from those of nuclear irradiation. Furthermore, experiments with radical scavenger and inhibitor of intracellular glutathione indicated that the mutagenicity of cytoplasmic irradiation depends on generation of reactive oxygen species. These findings suggest that cytoplasm is an important target for genotoxic effects of ionizing radiation, particularly radon, the second leading cause of lung cancer in the United States. In addition, cytoplasmic traversal by alpha particles may be more dangerous than nuclear traversal, because the mutagenicity is accomplished by little or no killing of the target cells.},

The wave functions were analyzed through the natural bond orbital, natural steric analysis, natural resonance theory, and atoms in molecules methods. The energy decomposition method proposed by Xantheas was used. The vibrational frequencies and the intensity of the O−H stretching bands, as well as the spin densities, were compared with experimental evidence. The results allowed the characterization of the hydrogen bonds formed in the complexation of the acids with the hydroperoxyl radical. Complexation led to significant alterations in the equilibrium geometry of the monomers. Energetic analysis proved that the studied complexes are stable and allowed the understanding of the effect of the electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups in their stabilization. The alterations in the electronic structure of the monomers after complexation led to an increase in the resonance of the carboxyl group, which can be partially attributed to the hydrogen bond.},

Immunometabolism has primarily focused on glycolysis, the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) as well as free fatty acid synthesis and oxidation. These pathways are important for providing the energy needs of cell growth, membrane rigidity, cytokine production and proliferation. In this review, we will however, highlight the specific role of iron metabolism at the cellular and organismal level, as well as how the bioavailability of this metal orchestrates complex metabolic programs in immune cell homeostasis and inflammation.

	abstract = {Mitochondrial aconitase (m-aconitase) contains a [4Fe-4S]$^{\textrm{2+}}$ cluster in its active site that catalyzes the stereospecific dehydration-rehydration of citrate to isocitrate in the Krebs cycle. It has been proposed that the [4Fe-4S]$^{\textrm{2+}}$ aconitase is oxidized by superoxide, generating the inactive [3Fe-4S]$^{\textrm{1+}}$ aconitase. In this reaction, the likely products are iron(II) and hydrogen peroxide. Consequently, the inactivation of m-aconitase by superoxide may increase the formation of hydroxyl radical ($^{\textrm{⋅}}$OH) through the Fenton reaction in mitochondria. In this work, evidence for the generation of $^{\textrm{⋅}}$OH from the reaction of m-aconitase with superoxide is provided using ESR spin trapping experiments with 5-diethoxyphosphoryl-5-methyl-1-pyrroline \textit{N}-oxide and α-phenyl-\textit{N}-\textit{tert}-butylnitrone. Formation of free $^{\textrm{⋅}}$OH was verified with the $^{\textrm{⋅}}$OH scavenger Me$_{\textrm{2}}$SO, which forms methyl radical upon reacting with$^{\textrm{⋅}}$OH. The addition of Me$_{\textrm{2}}$SO to incubation mixtures containing m-aconitase and xanthine/xanthine oxidase yielded methyl radical, which was detected by ESR spin trapping. Methyl radical formation was further confirmed using [$^{\textrm{13}}$C]Me$_{\textrm{2}}$SO. Parallel low temperature ESR experiments demonstrated that the generation of the [3Fe-4S]$^{\textrm{1+}}$ cluster increased with increasing additions of superoxide to m-aconitase. This reaction was reversible, as {\textgreater}90\% of the initial aconitase activity was recovered upon treatment with glutathione and iron(II). This mechanism presents a scenario in which$^{\textrm{⋅}}$OH may be continuously generated in the mitochondria.},

Mitochondria have been thought to both play a major role in tissue oxidative damage and dysfunction and provide protection against excessive tissue dysfunction through several mechanisms, including stimulation of opening of permeability transition pores. Until recently, the functional significance of ROS sources different from mitochondria has received lesser attention. However, the most recent data, besides confirming the mitochondrial role in tissue oxidative stress and protection, show interplay between mitochondria and other ROS cellular sources, so that activation of one can lead to activation of other sources. Thus, it is currently accepted that in various conditions all cellular sources of ROS provide significant contribution to processes that oxidatively damage tissues and assure their survival, through mechanisms such as autophagy and apoptosis.},

To maximize the efficiency of the ET process, one needs to master the art of tuning the redox potential, especially in metalloproteins, as they represent major classes of ET proteins. In this review, we first describe the importance of tuning the redox potential of ET centers and its role in regulating the ET in bioenergetic processes including photosynthesis and respiration. The main focus of this review is to summarize recent work in designing the ET centers, namely cupredoxins, cytochromes, and iron–sulfur proteins, and examples in design of protein networks involved these ET centers. We then discuss the factors that affect redox potentials of these ET centers including metal ion, the ligands to metal center and interactions beyond the primary ligand, especially non-covalent secondary coordination sphere interactions. We provide examples of strategies to fine-tune the redox potential using both natural and unnatural amino acids and native and nonnative cofactors. Several case studies are used to illustrate recent successes in this area. Outlooks for future endeavors are also provided.

The structure of three of these assemblies (photosystem I, photosystem II and the cytochrome-b6f complex) were recently solved by X-ray crystallography, and the structure of the fourth (ATP synthase or F-ATPase) can be deduced from its mitochondrial relative, the structure of which is largely known.In photosystem II, a cluster of four manganese ions, plus a calcium ion and a chloride ion, is responsible for water oxidation. A recent structure sheds light on the arrangement of this cluster and provides important insights into the mechanism of light-dependant oxygen evolution.Structures of the cytochrome-b6f complex — which mediates electron transfer between photosystem II and photosystem I — have, surprisingly, revealed the position of unexpected cofactors that might have an important role in cyclic photophosphorylation.A recently solved structure of plant photosystem I provides the first example of a supercomplex, which is composed of a reaction centre similar to that of cyanobacteria and a light-harvesting complex that is unique to the chloroplasts of eukaryotes.Together, the structures of these complexes form a unique body of information that has helped us to understand the architecture of oxygenic photosynthesis, which is one of the most intricate and fundamental processes of life.},

	abstract = {Free radicals vary widely in their thermodynamic properties, ranging from very oxidizing to very reducing. These thermodynamic properties can be used to predict a pecking order, or hierarchy, for free radical reactions. Using one-electron reduction potentials, the predicted pecking order is in agreement with experimentally observed free radical electron (hydrogen atom) transfer reactions. These potentials are also in agreement with experimental data that suggest that vitamin E, the primary lipid soluble small molecule antioxidant, and vitamin C, the terminal water soluble small molecule antioxidant, cooperate to protect lipids and lipid structures against peroxidation. Although vitamin E is located in membranes and vitamin C is located in aqueous phases, vitamin C is able to recycle vitamin E; i.e., vitamin C repairs the tocopheroxyl (chromanoxyl) radical of vitamin E, thereby permitting vitamin E to function again as a free radical chain-breaking antioxidant. This review discusses: (i) the thermodynamics of free radical reactions that are of interest to the health sciences; (ii) the fundamental thermodynamic and kinetic properties that are associated with chain-breaking antioxidants; (iii) the unique interfacial nature of the apparent reaction of the tocopherol free radical (vitamin E radical) and vitamin C; and (iv) presents a hierarchy, or pecking order, for free radical electron (hydrogen atom) transfer reactions.},

A more sophisticated version is discussed here, not only because it should be taught in more advanced courses, but because it is important that it is understood by instructors and textbook writers so that incorrect explanations of the VSEPR model are not given. The difficulties associated with the usual treatment of the VB and MO theories in connection with molecular geometry in beginning courses are discussed. It is recommended that the VB and MO theories should be presented only after the VSEPR model either in the general chemistry course or in a following course, particularly in the case of the MO theory, which is not really necessary for the first-year course. The Pauli principle and its importance as the fundamental basis of the VSEPR model should be presented in a higher-level course, such as a quantum mechanics or physical chemistry course, or an inorganic course, in which VSEPR has many applications, for example, in the discussion of noble gas and other high coordination number molecules.},

Using two independent approaches, we investigate the reactivity of O2 impinging onto platinum and resolve how step edges on (111) terraces enhance sticking. At low incident energy, the linear dependence on step density, independence of step type, and insensitivity to O2’s molecular alignment show that trapping into a physisorbed state precedes molecular chemisorption and dissociation. At higher impact energies, direct molecular chemisorption occurs in parallel on steps and terraces. While terraces are insensitive to alignment of the molecule within the (111) plane, steps favor molecules impacting with their internuclear axis parallel to the edge. Stereodynamical filtering thus controls sticking and dissociation of O2 on Pt with a twofold role of steps.},

The focus is on two type of metallic surfaces: platinum single crystals and bimetallic surfaces based on platinum. The single crystal results provide insight into the effects of the platinum structure on the kinetics of the ORR, and create a fundamental link between the specific activity of Pt (rate per unit area) and particle size (for various particle shapes). The results show that the structure sensitive kinetics of the ORR arise primarily due to structure sensitive adsorption of anions. In the absence of specific adsorption, such as in Nafion polymer electrolyte, no particle size effect is expected. The knowledge of the electrocatalysis of the ORR on model bimetallic surfaces on Pt-Ni and Pt-Co bulk alloys was used to resolve the enhanced ORR kinetics on supported Pt-Ni and Pt-Co catalysts. Finally, we show that the ORR on platinum modified with pseudomorphic Pd metal film in alkaline solution is the best catalysts ever used in O2 reduction. For both bimetallic systems, we demonstrated that the ability to make a controlled and well characterized arrangement of two elements in the electrode surface region presage a new era of advances in the ORR electrocatalysis.},

	abstract = {Catalytic exhaust aftertreatment of vehicle engines is increasingly employed to the benefit of the atmosphere quality, especially in the large urban area of the world. Both spark-ignition and compression-ignition engines benefit from the application of catalytic converters for the elimination of their main pollutants. Catalysts are further employed in various forms as regeneration aids in particulate filters of diesel engines. The especially demanding exhaust gas conditions prevailing in each engine application pose challenging problems to the emissions control engineer. The attainment of strict emissions regulations requires highly active and durable catalysts, as well as optimized exhaust system design and engine controls. This paper reviews the potential of catalytic systems in automobile emission control. The review covers the catalyst technology applicable in each case, the operating principles and performance characteristics, durability aspects and considerations regarding the interactions between catalyst performance and engine management. The concise presentation of related mathematical model equations provides insight into the catalytic mechanisms and the physical phenomena involved. Further reductions of catalytically controlled automobile emissions may be attained by developing improved and more durable catalysts, by applying a systems approach in designing optimized engine-exhaust aftertreatment configurations, as well as by efficient control of in-use catalytic systems through inspection, maintenance and on-board diagnostics.},

	abstract = {The significant increase in human lifespan during the past century confronts us with great medical challenges. To meet these challenges, the mechanisms that determine healthy ageing must be understood and controlled. Sirtuins are highly conserved deacetylases that have been shown to regulate lifespan in yeast, nematodes and fruitflies. However, the role of sirtuins in regulating worm and fly lifespan has recently become controversial. Moreover, the role of the seven mammalian sirtuins, SIRT1 to SIRT7 (homologues of the yeast sirtuin Sir2), in regulating lifespan is unclear. Here we show that male, but not female, transgenic mice overexpressing Sirt6 (ref. 4) have a significantly longer lifespan than wild-type mice. Gene expression analysis revealed significant differences between male Sirt6-transgenic mice and male wild-type mice: transgenic males displayed lower serum levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), higher levels of IGF-binding protein 1 and altered phosphorylation levels of major components of IGF1 signalling, a key pathway in the regulation of lifespan. This study shows the regulation of mammalian lifespan by a sirtuin family member and has important therapeutic implications for age-related diseases.},

However, nonhistone substrates and additional catalytic activities of SIRT6, including long-chain deacylation and mono-ADP-ribosylation of other proteins, have also been reported, but many of these noncanonical roles remain enigmatic. Genetic studies have revealed critical homeostatic cellular functions of SIRT6, underscoring the need to better understand which catalytic functions and molecular pathways are driving SIRT6-associated phenotypes. At the physiological level, SIRT6 activity promotes increased longevity by regulating metabolism and DNA repair. Recent work has identified natural products and synthetic small molecules capable of activating the inefficient \textit{in vitro} deacetylase activity of SIRT6. Here, we discuss the cellular functions of SIRT6 with a focus on attributing its catalytic activity to its proposed biological functions. We cover the molecular architecture and catalytic mechanisms that distinguish SIRT6 from other NAD$^{\textrm{+}}$-dependent deacylases. We propose that combining specific SIRT6 amino acid substitutions identified in enzymology studies and activity-selective compounds could help delineate SIRT6 functions in specific biological contexts and resolve the apparently conflicting roles of SIRT6 in processes such as tumor development. We further highlight the recent development of small-molecule modulators that provide additional biological insight into SIRT6 functions and offer therapeutic approaches to manage metabolic and age-associated diseases.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Sirt6 activation protects against metabolic and aging-related diseases, and Sirt6 inhibition is considered a cancer therapy. Available Sirt6 modulators show insufficient potency and specificity, and even partially contradictory Sirt6 effects were reported for the plant flavone quercetin. To understand Sirt6 modulation by quercetin-based compounds, we analysed their binding and activity effects on Sirt6 and other Sirtuin isoforms and solved crystal structures of compound complexes with Sirt6 and Sirt2. We find that quercetin activates Sirt6 via the isoform-specific binding site for pyrrolo[1,2-a]quinoxalines. Its inhibitory effect on other isoforms is based on an alternative binding site at the active site entrance. Based on these insights, we identified isoquercetin as a ligand that can discriminate both sites and thus activates Sirt6 with increased specificity. Furthermore, we find that quercetin derivatives that inhibit rather than activate Sirt6 exploit the same general Sirt6 binding site as the activators, identifying it as a versatile allosteric site for Sirt6 modulation. Our results thus provide a structural basis for Sirtuin effects of quercetin-related compounds and helpful insights for Sirt6-targeted drug development.},

We immobilized SIRT6 onto the surface of magnetic beads, and assessed SIRT6 enzymatic activity on synthetic acetylated histone tails (H3K9Ac) by measuring products of the deacetylation process. The SIRT6 coated magnetic beads were then suspended in fenugreek seed extract (Trigonella foenum-graecum) as a bait to identify active ligands that suppress SIRT6 activity. While the entire extract also inhibited SIRT6 activity in a cell-based assay, the inhibitory effect of two flavonoids from this extract, quercetin and vitexin, was only detected in vitro. This is the first report on the use of protein-coated magnetic beads for the identification of an active ligand from a botanical matrix, and it sets the basis for the de novo identification of SIRT6 modulators from complex biological mixtures.},

Due to their plethora of biological activities, they have been studied extensively in drug development. They have been shown to modulate the activity of a NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase, SIRT6. Because SIRT6 has been implicated in longevity, metabolism, DNA-repair, and inflammatory response reduction, it is an interesting target in inflammatory and metabolic diseases as well as in cancer. Here we show, that flavonoids can alter SIRT6 activity in a structure dependent manner. Catechin derivatives with galloyl moiety displayed significant inhibition potency against SIRT6 at 10 µM concentration. The most potent SIRT6 activator, cyanidin, belonged to anthocyanidins, and produced a 55-fold increase in SIRT6 activity compared to the 3-10 fold increase for the others. Cyanidin also significantly increased SIRT6 expression in Caco-2 cells. Results from the docking studies indicated possible binding sites for the inhibitors and activators. Inhibitors likely bind in a manner that could disturb NAD+ binding. The putative activator binding site was found next to a loop near the acetylated peptide substrate binding site. In some cases, the activators changed the conformation of this loop suggesting that it may play a role in SIRT6 activation.},

	abstract = {Hund's multiplicity rule, according to which a high spin state has a lower energy than any other state of lower spin arising from the same configuration, was deduced from atomic spectra immediately before the advent of modern quantum mechanics. Since then, the lower energy of the state of higher multiplicity has generally been explained by assuming greater electron repulsion in the lower spin states. Numerous calculations1–13 have shown, however, that the traditional explanation of Hund's rule is invalid. In every neutral species for which the requisite calculations have been carried out, the electron–electron repulsion, Vee, is greater in the high spin state, and the lower energy of the high spin state is due to its greater electron–nucleus attraction, Ven. I show here that Hund's rule is a consequence of the Fermi correlation between electrons with parallel spin which leads to less screening of the nucleus in the high spin state.},

This, in turn, alters the way these molecules interact with reactive oxygen species, so that the in vivo behavior may be quite different from that seen in solution. The effectiveness of carotenoids as antioxidants is also dependent upon their interaction with other coantioxidants, especially vitamins E and C. Carotenoids may, however, lose their effectiveness as antioxidants at high concentrations or at high partial pressures of oxygen.

	abstract = {Oxygen-derived free radicals and related oxidants are ubiquitous and short-lived intermediates formed in aerobic organisms throughout life. These reactive species participate in redox reactions leading to oxidative modifications in biomolecules, among which proteins and lipids are preferential targets. Despite a broad array of enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant systems in mammalian cells and microbes, excess oxidant formation causes accumulation of new products that may compromise cell function and structure leading to cell degeneration and death. Oxidative events are associated with pathological conditions and the process of normal aging. Notably, physiological levels of oxidants also modulate cellular functions via homeostatic redox-sensitive cell signaling cascades. On the other hand, nitric oxide (•NO), a free radical and weak oxidant, represents a master physiological regulator via reversible interactions with heme proteins. The bioavailability and actions of •NO are modulated by its fast reaction with superoxide radical ([Formula: see text]), which yields an unusual and reactive peroxide, peroxynitrite, representing the merging of the oxygen radicals and •NO pathways. In this Inaugural Article, I summarize early and remarkable developments in free radical biochemistry and the later evolution of the field toward molecular medicine; this transition includes our contributions disclosing the relationship of •NO with redox intermediates and metabolism. The biochemical characterization, identification, and quantitation of peroxynitrite and its role in disease processes have concentrated much of our attention. Being a mediator of protein oxidation and nitration, lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cell death, peroxynitrite represents both a pathophysiologically relevant endogenous cytotoxin and a cytotoxic effector against invading pathogens.},

	abstract = {The production of ROS (reactive oxygen species) by mammalian mitochondria is important because it underlies oxidative damage in many pathologies and contributes to retrograde redox signalling from the organelle to the cytosol and nucleus. Superoxide (O2•−) is the proximal mitochondrial ROS, and in the present review I outline the principles that govern O2•− production within the matrix of mammalian mitochondria. The flux of O2•− is related to the concentration of potential electron donors, the local concentration of O2 and the second-order rate constants for the reactions between them. Two modes of operation by isolated mitochondria result in significant O2•− production, predominantly from complex I: (i) when the mitochondria are not making ATP and consequently have a high Δp (protonmotive force) and a reduced CoQ (coenzyme Q) pool; and (ii) when there is a high NADH/NAD+ ratio in the mitochondrial matrix. For mitochondria that are actively making ATP, and consequently have a lower Δp and NADH/NAD+ ratio, the extent of O2•− production is far lower. The generation of O2•− within the mitochondrial matrix depends critically on Δp, the NADH/NAD+ and CoQH2/CoQ ratios and the local O2 concentration, which are all highly variable and difficult to measure in vivo. Consequently, it is not possible to estimate O2•− generation by mitochondria in vivo from O2•−-production rates by isolated mitochondria, and such extrapolations in the literature are misleading. Even so, the description outlined here facilitates the understanding of factors that favour mitochondrial ROS production. There is a clear need to develop better methods to measure mitochondrial O2•− and H2O2 formation in vivo, as uncertainty about these values hampers studies on the role of mitochondrial ROS in pathological oxidative damage and redox signalling.},

	abstract = {Most biogerontologists agree that oxygen (and nitrogen) free radicals play a major role in the process of aging. The evidence strongly suggests that the electron transport chain, located in the inner mitochondrial membrane, is the major source of reactive oxygen species in animal cells. It has been reported that there exists an inverse correlation between the rate of superoxide/hydrogen peroxide production by mitochondria and the maximum longevity of mammalian species. However, no correlation or most frequently an inverse correlation exists between the amount of antioxidant enzymes and maximum longevity. Although overexpression of the antioxidant enzymes SOD1 and CAT (as well as SOD1 alone) have been successful at extending maximum lifespan in Drosophila, this has not been the case in mice. Several labs have overexpressed SOD1 and failed to see a positive effect on longevity. An explanation for this failure is that there is some level of superoxide damage that is not preventable by SOD, such as that initiated by the hydroperoxyl radical inside the lipid bilayer, and that accumulation of this damage is responsible for aging. I therefore suggest an alternative approach to testing the free radical theory of aging in mammals. Instead of trying to increase the amount of antioxidant enzymes, I suggest using molecular biology/transgenics to decrease the rate of superoxide production, which in the context of the free radical theory of aging would be expected to increase longevity. This paper aims to summarize what is known about the nature and mechanisms of superoxide production and what genes are involved in controlling the rate of superoxide production.},

	abstract = {As part of a study on mechanisms modulating ozone-induced surfactant perturbations, we used the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spin trapping technique to determine the type and origin of radicals generated following interaction of ozone with aqueous solutions and cell-free bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) fractions. All aqueous media were exposed to ozone at 25°C with or without added chelator, 1 mM diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, and spintrap, 100 mM 5,5′-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-1-oxide (DMPO). Exposure of distilled water to 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 ppm ozone for 1 h yielded four-line spectra, 1:2:2:1, consistent with hydroxyl radical adduct formation (DMPO-OH), the amplitudes of which increased with the ozone concentration. No signals were obtained from air-exposed samples. Similar four-line spectra were also produced following interaction of 3 ppm ozone with Hank′s balanced salt solution (HBSS) alone or containing BAL; fractions. Addition of the hydroxyl radical scavenger dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to the incubation medium strongly inhibited formation of DMPO-OH adduct during ozone exposure. As an alternate method of demonstrating the generation of hydroxyl radicals, aqueous solutions of 1 mM L-phenylalanine were exposed to high concentrations of ozone and shown, using ion-exchange chromatography, to contain small amounts of L-tyrosine. Production of hydroxyl radicals upon interaction of ozone and water was further substantiated using the spintrap PBN (phenyl-N-tert-butylnitrone) in the presence of DMSO which reacts with the hydroxyl radical resulting in the formation of methyl radical. The methyl radical subsequently reacts with spintrap PBN, yielding PBN-methyl adduct. In the absence of DMSO there was no detectable formation of methyl radical adduct. EPR double distilled water containing DMPO showed a small amount of DMPO-OH adduct upon exposure to ozone. Addition of 10 μM ferrous sulfate to this mixture produced a 10-fold increase of the signal, which was attenuated in the presence of 1500 U catalase, strongly attenuated with 50-500 μM deferoxamine or 8000 U catalase and abolished by higher concentrations of deferoxamine (1 mM). The signal was not influenced by 1000 U superoxide dismutase. These results indicate that hydroxyl radicals are produced via iron-dependent reactions during the initial interaction of ozone with aqueous media, including bronchoalveolar fluid.},

In this study, high concentrations of OH radicals were found when people were exposed to ozone in a climate-controlled chamber. OH concentrations calculated by two methods using measurements of total OH reactivity, speciated alkenes, and oxidation products were consistent with those obtained from a chemically explicit model. Key to establishing this human-induced oxidation field is 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one (6-MHO), which forms when ozone reacts with the skin-oil squalene and subsequently generates OH efficiently through gas-phase reaction with ozone. A dynamic model was used to show the spatial extent of the human-generated OH oxidation field and its dependency on ozone influx through ventilation. This finding has implications for the oxidation, lifetime, and perception of chemicals indoors and, ultimately, human health.},

	abstract = {This study has used proton transfer reaction-mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) for direct air analyses of volatile products resulting from the reactions of ozone with human skin lipids. An initial series of small-scale in vitro and in vivo experiments were followed by experiments conducted with human subjects in a simulated office. The latter were conducted using realistic ozone mixing ratios (≈15 ppb with occupants present). Detected products included mono- and bifunctional compounds that contain carbonyl, carboxyl, or α-hydroxy ketone groups. Among these, three previously unreported dicarbonyls have been identified, and two previously unreported α-hydroxy ketones have been tentatively identified. The compounds detected in this study (excepting acetone) have been overlooked in surveys of indoor pollutants, reflecting the limitations of the analytical methods routinely used to monitor indoor air. The results are fully consistent with the Criegee mechanism for ozone reacting with squalene, the single most abundant unsaturated constituent of skin lipids, and several unsaturated fatty acid moieties in their free or esterified forms. Quantitative product analysis confirms that squalene is the major scavenger of ozone at the interface between room air and the human envelope. Reactions between ozone and human skin lipids reduce the mixing ratio of ozone in indoor air, but concomitantly increase the mixing ratios of volatile products and, presumably, skin surface concentrations of less volatile products. Some of the volatile products, especially the dicarbonyls, may be respiratory irritants. Some of the less volatile products may be skin irritants.},

	abstract = {Ozone (O3) is the major oxidant of photochemical smog. Its biological effect is attributed to its ability to cause oxidation or peroxidation of biomolecules directly and/or via free radical reactions. A sequence of events may include lipid peroxidation and loss of functional groups of enzymes, alteration of membrane permeability, and cell injury or death. An acute exposure to O3 causes lung injury involving the ciliated cell in the airways and the type 1 epithelial cell in the alveolar region. The effects are particularly localized at the junction of terminal bronchioles and alveolar ducts, as evident from a loss of cells and accumulation of inflammatory cells. In a typical short-term exposure the lung tissue response is biphasic: an initial injury-phase characterized by cell damage and loss of enzyme activities, followed by a repair-phase associated with increased metabolic activities, which coincide with a proliferation of metabolically active cells, for example, the alveolar type 2 cells and the bronchiolar Clara cells. A chronic exposure to O3 can cause or exacerbate lung diseases, including perhaps an increased lung tumor incidence in susceptible animal models. Ozone exposure also causes extrapulmonary effects involving the blood, spleen, central nervous system, and other organs. A combination of O3 and NO2, both of which occur in photochemical smog, can produce effects which may be additive or synergistic. A synergistic lung injury occurs possibly due to a formation of more powerful radicals and chemical intermediates. Dietary antioxidants, for example, vitamin E, vitamin C, and selenium, can offer a protection against O3 effects.},

To better understand the high reactivity of 7-DHC and elucidate the reaction mechanism, we synthesized conjugated and skipped nonconjugated cholestadienols that would give one of the two putative pentadienyl-radical intermediates formed in 7-DHC peroxidation. The additional dienols include 6,8(9)-dienol, 5,8(14)-dienol, 6,8(14)-dienol, and the biologically important 8-dehydrocholesterol (8-DHC; 5,8(9)-dienol). We found that all of the dienols are significantly (at least 40 times) more reactive than cholesterol. Among them, dienols leading to the formation of the pentadienyl radical in ring B (termed endo-B) of the sterol are more reactive than those leading to the pentadienyl radical spanning rings B and C (termed exo-B). By comparing the oxysterol profile formed from 7-DHC and those formed from 8-DHC and 5,8(14)-dienol, products formed from abstraction of the hydrogen atoms at C-9 and C-14 (H-9 or H-14 mechanism) were clearly differentiated. When the oxidation was carried out in the presence of the good hydrogen atom donor α-tocopherol, the oxysterol profile of 7-DHC peroxidation differed distinctly from the profile observed in the absence of the antioxidant and resembles more closely the profile observed in biological systems. This study suggests that oxidative stress and the accumulation of oxysterols should be considered as two key factors in cholesterol biosynthesis or metabolism disorders, where dienyl sterol intermediates are accumulated.},

In vitro cellular, as well as in vivo, studies of oxidizability have generally relied upon chemical indicators of peroxidation such as thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances. To examine the oxidizability of lipids in cells, we have measured oxygen uptake and, using electron paramagnetic resonance spin trapping with alpha-(1-oxo-4-pyridyl)-N-tert-butylnitrone (POBN), the real time generation of lipid-derived free radicals. We have used our experimental in vitro cellular lipid modification model to examine the rate and extent of lipid peroxidation versus the degree of lipid unsaturation in L1210 murine leukemia cells. Lipid peroxidation was stimulated using the prooxidants iron, ascorbate, and the ether lipid compound 1-O-octadecyl-2-O-methyl-rac-glycero-3-phosphocholine. We did a total cellular lipid analysis to determine the number of lipid carbon-carbon double bonds contained in L1210 cells enriched with eight fatty acids of different degrees of unsaturation. We found in cellular lipids that (i) lipid chain length had no apparent effect on the rate or extent of radical formation; (ii) the maximum amount of lipid radical generated increases with the total number of bis-allylic positions in the cellular lipids; and, most importantly, (iii) the rate of cellular lipid peroxidation increases exponentially with the number of bis-allylic positions. Our quantitative results clearly demonstrate, for the first time, that the number of bis-allylic positions contained in the cellular lipids of intact cells determines their susceptibility, i.e., oxidizability, to free radical-mediated peroxidative events.},

	abstract = {Human coronary and peripheral arteries show endothelial dysfunction in a variety of conditions, including atherosclerosis, hypercholesterolemia, smoking, and hypertension. This dysfunction manifests as a loss of endothelium-dependent vasodilation to acetylcholine infusion or sheer stress, and is typically associated with decreased generation of nitric oxide (NO) by the endothelium. Vitamin C, or ascorbic acid, when acutely infused or chronically ingested, improves the defective endothelium-dependent vasodilation present in these clinical conditions. The mechanism of the ascorbic acid effect is unknown, although it has been attributed to an antioxidant function of the vitamin to enhance the synthesis or prevent the breakdown of NO. In this review, multiple mechanisms are considered that might account for the ability of ascorbate to preserve NO. These include ascorbate-induced decreases in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation, scavenging of intracellular superoxide, release of NO from circulating or tissue S-nitrosothiols, direct reduction of nitrite to NO, and activation of either endothelial NO synthase or smooth muscle guanylate cyclase. The ability of ascorbic acid supplements to enhance defective endothelial function in human diseases provides a rationale for use of such supplements in these conditions. However, it is first necessary to determine which of the many plausible mechanisms account for the effect, and to ensure that undesirable toxic effects are not present.},

	abstract = {Ascorbic acid can recycle α-tocopherol from the tocopheroxyl free radical in lipid bilayers and in micelles, but such recycling has not been demonstrated to occur across cell membranes. In this work the ability of intracellular ascorbate to protect and to recycle α-tocopherol in intact human erythrocytes and erythrocyte ghosts was investigated. In erythrocytes that were 80\% depleted of intracellular ascorbate by treatment with the nitroxide Tempol, both 2,2′-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH) and ferricyanide oxidized α-tocopherol to a greater extent than in cells not depleted of ascorbate. In contrast, in erythrocytes in which the intracellular ascorbate concentration had been increased by loading with dehydroascorbate, loss of α-tocopherol was less with both oxidants than in control cells. Protection against AAPH-induced oxidation of α-tocopherol was not prevented by extracellular ascorbate oxidase, indicating that the protection was due to intracellular and not to extracellular ascorbate. Incubation of erythrocytes with lecithin liposomes also generated an oxidant stress, which caused lipid peroxidation in the liposomes and depleted erythrocyte α-tocopherol, leading to hemolysis. Ascorbate loading of the erythrocytes delayed liposome oxidation and decreased loss of α-tocopherol from both cells and from α-tocopherol-loaded liposomes. When erythrocyte ghosts were resealed to contain ascorbate and challenged with free radicals generated by AAPH outside the ghosts, intravesicular ascorbate was totally depleted over 1 h of incubation, whereas α-tocopherol decreased only after ascorbate was substantially oxidized. These results suggest that ascorbate within the erythrocyte protects α-tocopherol in the cell membrane by a direct recycling mechanism.},

This happens because removal of an electron from monodehydroascorbate would create a tricarbonyl structure that is energetically unfavored. Instead of forming this structure, ascorbic acid oxidizes only to monodehydroascorbate, and monodehydroascorbate reacts with other radicals, oxidizing by mechanisms that may circumvent formation of this unfavored structure. Ironically, this tricarbonyl compound, which we suggest be called pseudodehydroascorbate, is commonly and mistakenly cited as the real product of ascorbic acid oxidation. In fact, it has been known for over 40 years that dehydroascorbate has a bicyclic hemiketal structure, and kinetic considerations suggest that it may be produced and reduced without forming pseudodehydroascorbate as an intermediate.

We report the distinct lipidomes and biophysical properties of both monolayers in living mammalian PMs. Phospholipid unsaturation is dramatically asymmetric, with the cytoplasmic leaflet being approximately twofold more unsaturated than the exoplasmic leaflet. Atomistic simulations and spectroscopy of leaflet-selective fluorescent probes reveal that the outer PM leaflet is more packed and less diffusive than the inner leaflet, with this biophysical asymmetry maintained in the endocytic system. The structural asymmetry of the PM is reflected in the asymmetric structures of protein transmembrane domains. These structural asymmetries are conserved throughout Eukaryota, suggesting fundamental cellular design principles.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Therapeutic selectivity is one of the most important considerations in cancer chemotherapy. The design of therapeutic strategies to preferentially kill malignant cells while minimizing harmful effects to normal cells depends on our understanding of the biological differences between cancer and normal cells. We have previously demonstrated that certain agents generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as 2-methoxyestradiol (2-ME) preferentially kill human leukemia cells without exhibiting significant cytotoxicity in normal lymphocytes. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the biochemical basis for such selective anticancer activity.
METHODS: Flow cytometric analyses were utilized to measure intracellular O(2)(-) levels and apoptosis. MTT assays were used as indicators of cellular viability. Western blot analysis was used to measure the expression of antioxidant enzymes in cancer and normal cells.
RESULTS: Malignant cells in general are more active than normal cells in the production of O(2)(-), are under intrinsic oxidative stress, and thus are more vulnerable to damage by ROS-generating agents. The intrinsic oxidative stress in cancer cells was associated with the upregulation of SOD and catalase protein expression, likely as a mechanism to tolerate increased ROS stress. The increase in SOD and catalase expression was observed both in primary human leukemia cells and in primary ovarian cancer cells. Both malignant cell types were more sensitive to 2-ME than their normal counterparts, as demonstrated by the significant accumulation of O(2)(-) and subsequent apoptosis. The administration of ROS scavengers in combination with 2-ME prevented the accumulation of O(2)(-) and abrogated apoptosis induction.
CONCLUSIONS: O(2)(-) is an important mediator of 2-ME-induced apoptosis. The increased oxidative stress in cancer cells forces these cells to rely more on antioxidant enzymes such as SOD for O(2)(-) elimination, thus making the malignant cells more vulnerable to SOD inhibition than normal cells.},

The oxidized phospholipid (OxPL) OxPAPC was identified to induce lung injury and cytokine production by lung macrophages via TLR4-TRIF. We observed OxPL production in the lungs of humans and animals infected with SARS, Anthrax, or H5N1. Pulmonary challenge with an inactivated H5N1 avian influenza virus rapidly induces ALI and OxPL formation in mice. Loss of TLR4 or TRIF expression protects mice from H5N1-induced ALI. Moreover, deletion of ncf1, which controls ROS production, improves the severity of H5N1-mediated ALI.

	abstract = {Aging is the progressive accumulation of changes with time that are associated with or responsible for the ever-increasing susceptibility to disease and death which accompanies advancing age. These time-related changes are attributed to the aging process. The nature of the aging process has been the subject of considerable speculation. Accumulating evidence now indicates that the sum of the deleterious free radical reactions going on continuously throughout the cells and tissues constitutes the aging process or is a major contributor to it. In mammalian systems the free radical reactions are largely those involving oxygen. Dietary manipulations expected to lower the rate of production of free radical reaction damage have been shown (i) to increase the life span of mice, rats, fruit flies, nematodes, and rotifers, as well as the "life span" of neurospora; (ii) to inhibit development of some forms of cancer; (iii) to enhance humoral and cell-mediated immune responses; and (iv) to slow development of amyloidosis and the autoimmune disorders of NZB and NZB/NZW mice. In addition, studies strongly suggest that free radical reactions play a significant role in the deterioration of the cardiovascular and central nervous systems with age. The free radical theory of aging provides reasonable explanations for age-associated phenomena, including (i) the relationship of the average life spans of mammalian species to their basal metabolic rates, (ii) the clustering of degenerative diseases in the terminal part of the life span, (iii) the beneficial effect of food restriction on life span, (iv) the greater longevity of females, and (v) the increase in autoimmune manifestations with age. It is not unreasonable to expect on the basis of present data that the healthy life span can be increased by 5-10 or more years by keeping body weight down, at a level compatible with a sense of well-being, while ingesting diets adequate in essential nutrients but designed to minimize random free radical reactions in the body.},

In most instances, sporadic and autosomal dominant familial ALS (FALS) are clinically similar4,6,7. We have previously shown that in some but not all FALS pedigrees the disease is linked to a genetic defect on chromosome 21q (refs 8,9). Here we report tight genetic linkage between FALS and a gene that encodes a cytosolic, Cu/Zn-binding superoxide dismutase (SOD1), a homodimeric metalloenzyme that catalyzes the dismutation of the toxic superoxide anion O–2 to O2 and H2O2 (ref. 10). Given this linkage and the potential role of free radical toxicity in other neurodenegerative disorders11, we investigated SOD1 as a candidate gene in FALS. We identified 11 different SOD1 missense mutations in 13 different FALS families.},

In mammals, the mechanisms that regulate stress response are poorly understood and no genes are known to increase individual life span.

We show that: (1) p66shc is serine phosphorylated upon treatment with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or irradiation with ultraviolet light; (2) ablation of p66shc enhances cellular resistance to apoptosis induced by H2O2 or ultraviolet light; (3) a serine-phosphorylation defective mutant of p66shc cannot restore the normal stress response in p66shc-/- cells; (4) the p53 and p21 stress response is impaired in p66shc-/- cells; (5) p66shc-/- mice have increased resistance to paraquat and a 30\% increase in life span.

	abstract = {Human monocytes, upon activation with opsonized zymosan, altered low-density lipoprotein (LDL) during a 24-h co-incubation, resulting in its oxidation and acquisition of cytotoxic activity against target fibroblast cell lines. Both the oxidation of LDL and its conversion to a cytotoxin were enhanced with time of incubation, with the most substantial changes occurring after 6 h of culture of LDL with activated monocytes. Unactivated monocytes did not mediate either alteration. Superoxide anion (O2-) participated in both the oxidation of LDL and its conversion to a cytotoxin since addition of superoxide dismutase (SOD) at the beginning of the co-incubation inhibited, in a concentration dependent fashion, both the monocyte-mediated oxidation and the monocyte-mediated conversion of LDL to a cytotoxin. As expected, the rate of superoxide anion release was greatest during the respiratory burst, very early in the 24-h incubation (0 to 2 h); however, exposure of LDL to monocytes during the respiratory burst was not required for LDL oxidation. The lower levels of O2- released by the cells hours after the respiratory burst had subsided were sufficient to lead to the initiation of LDL oxidation. Three results indicated that the oxidative modification of LDL into a cytotoxin required O2(-)-independent free radical propagation after O2(-)-dependent initiation. First, oxidation of LDL exposed to the activated, superoxide anion-releasing monocytes for 6 h could be almost completely blocked by the addition at 6 h of the general free radical scavenger butylated hydroxytoluene, but not by SOD. Second, LDL oxidation proceeded even after removal of LDL from the superoxide anion-producing, activated cells after various durations of exposure. Third, the development of substantial levels of lipid peroxidation products and the development of greater cytotoxicity occurred after 6 h of exposure of LDL to activated cells, long after peak O2- release had subsided. These results lead us to conclude that monocyte-mediated oxidation of LDL, leading to its transformation into a cytotoxin, requires release of O2- occurring as a result of activation but not necessarily during the respiratory burst, and also requires O2(-)-independent free radical propagation. The modification of LDL into a potent toxin by activated monocytes may explain the tissue damage in atherosclerotic lesions and other pathologic sites in which inflammatory cells congregate.},

	abstract = {All of the naturally occurring vitamin E forms, as well as those of synthetic all-rac-alpha-tocopherol, have relatively similar antioxidant properties, so why does the body prefer alpha-tocopherol as its unique form of vitamin E? We propose the hypothesis that all of the observations concerning the in vivo mechanism of action of alpha-tocopherol result from its role as a potent lipid-soluble antioxidant. The purpose of this review then is to describe the evidence for alpha-tocopherol's in vivo function and to make the claim that alpha-tocopherol's major vitamin function, if not only function, is that of a peroxyl radical scavenger. The importance of this function is to maintain the integrity of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in the membranes of cells and thus maintain their bioactivity. That is to say that these bioactive lipids are important signaling molecules and that changes in their amounts, or in their loss due to oxidation, are the key cellular events that are responded to by cells. The various signaling pathways that have been described by others to be under alpha-tocopherol regulation appear rather to be dependent on the oxidative stress of the cell or tissue under question. Moreover, it seems unlikely that these pathways are specifically under the control of alpha-tocopherol given that various antioxidants other than alpha-tocopherol and various oxidative stressors can manipulate their responses. Thus, virtually all of the variation and scope of vitamin E's biological activity can be seen and understood in the light of protection of polyunsaturated fatty acids and the membrane qualities (fluidity, phase separation, and lipid domains) that polyunsaturated fatty acids bring about.},

	abstract = {Since the discovery of vitamin C, the number of its known biological functions is continually expanding. Both the names ascorbic acid and vitamin C reflect its antiscorbutic properties due to its role in the synthesis of collagen in connective tissues. Ascorbate acts as an electron-donor keeping iron in the ferrous state thereby maintaining the full activity of collagen hydroxylases; parallel reactions with a variety of dioxygenases affect the expression of a wide array of genes, for example via the HIF system, as well as via the epigenetic landscape of cells and tissues. In fact, all known physiological and biochemical functions of ascorbate are due to its action as an electron donor. The ability to donate one or two electrons makes AscH− an excellent reducing agent and antioxidant. Ascorbate readily undergoes pH-dependent autoxidation producing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In the presence of catalytic metals this oxidation is accelerated. In this review, we show that the chemical and biochemical nature of ascorbate contribute to its antioxidant as well as its prooxidant properties. Recent pharmacokinetic data indicate that intravenous (i.v.) administration of ascorbate bypasses the tight control of the gut producing highly elevated plasma levels; ascorbate at very high levels can act as prodrug to deliver a significant flux of H2O2 to tumors. This new knowledge has rekindled interest and spurred new research into the clinical potential of pharmacological ascorbate. Knowledge and understanding of the mechanisms of action of pharmacological ascorbate bring a rationale to its use to treat disease especially the use of i.v. delivery of pharmacological ascorbate as an adjuvant in the treatment of cancer.},

Two tocopherol-deficient mutant loci in Arabidopsis thaliana were used to examine the functions of tocopherols in seedlings: vitamin e1 (vte1), which accumulates the pathway intermediate 2,3-dimethyl-5-phytyl-1,4-benzoquinone (DMPBQ); and vte2, which lacks all tocopherols and pathway intermediates. Only vte2 displayed severe seedling growth defects, which corresponded with massively increased levels of the major classes of nonenzymatic lipid peroxidation products: hydroxy fatty acids, malondialdehyde, and phytoprostanes. In the absence of pathogens, the phytoalexin camalexin accumulated in vte2 seedlings to levels 100-fold higher than in wild-type or vte1 seedlings. Similarly, gene expression profiling in wild-type, vte1, and vte2 seedlings indicated that increased levels of nonenzymatic lipid peroxidation in vte2 corresponded to increased expression of many defense-related genes, which were not induced in vte1. Both biochemical and transcriptional analyses of vte2 seedlings indicate that nonenzymatic lipid peroxidation plays a significant role in modulating plant defense responses. Together, these results establish that tocopherols in wild-type plants or DMPBQ in vte1 plants limit nonenzymatic lipid peroxidation during germination and early seedling development, thereby preventing the inappropriate activation of transcriptional and biochemical defense responses.},

A recently published systematic review described more than 230 structures that are derived from a chromanol ortpd chromenol core. For many of these compounds structure-activity relationships have been described with mostly anti-inflammatory as well as anti-carcinogenic activities. To extend the knowledge on the biological activity and the therapeutic potential of these promising class of natural compounds, we here present a report on selected chromanols and chromenols based on the availability of data on signaling pathways involved in inflammation, apoptosis, cell proliferation, and carcinogenesis. The chromanol and chromenol derivatives seem to bind or to interfere with several molecular targets and pathways, including 5-lipoxygenase, nuclear receptors, and the nuclear-factor “kappa-light-chain-enhancer” of activated B-cells (NFκB) pathway. Interestingly, available data suggest that the chromanols and chromenols are promiscuitively acting molecules that inhibit enzyme activities, bind to cellular receptors, and modulate mitochondrial function as well as gene expression. It is also noteworthy that the molecular modes of actions by which the chromanols and chromenols exert their effects strongly depend on the concentrations of the compounds. Thereby, low- and high-affinity molecular targets can be classified. This review summarizes the available knowledge on the biological activity of selected chromanols and chromenols which may represent interesting lead structures for the development of therapeutic anti-inflammatory and chemopreventive approaches.},

	abstract = {This article is a review of the fundamental chemistry of the tocopherols and tocotrienols relevant to their antioxidant action. Despite the general agreement that alpha-tocopherol is the most efficient antioxidant and vitamin E homologue in vivo, there was always a considerable discrepancy in its "absolute" and "relative" antioxidant effectiveness in vitro, especially when compared to gamma-tocopherol. Many chemical, physical, biochemical, physicochemical, and other factors seem responsible for the observed discrepancy between the relative antioxidant potencies of the tocopherols in vivo and in vitro. This paper aims at highlighting some possible reasons for the observed differences between the tocopherols (alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-) in relation to their interactions with the important chemical species involved in lipid peroxidation, specifically trace metal ions, singlet oxygen, nitrogen oxides, and antioxidant synergists. Although literature reports related to the chemistry of the tocotrienols are quite meager, they also were included in the discussion in virtue of their structural and functional resemblance to the tocopherols.},

	abstract = {Vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol), the principal chain-breaking antioxidant in biological membranes, prevents toxicant- and carcinogen-induced oxidative damage by trapping reactive oxyradicals. Although alpha-tocopherol antioxidant reactions appear to be not under direct metabolic control, alpha-tocopherol may function through redox cycles, which deliver reducing equivalents for antioxidant reactions and link antioxidant function to cellular metabolism. This review describes the antioxidant chemistry of alpha-tocopherol and evaluates the experimental evidence for the linkage of alpha-tocopherol turnover to cellular metabolism through redox cycles. Numerous in vitro experiments demonstrate antioxidant synergism between alpha-tocopherol and ascorbate, reduced glutathione, NADPH, and cellular electron transport proteins. Nevertheless, evidence that a one-electron redox cycle regenerates alpha-tocopherol from the tocopheroxyl radical is inconclusive. The difficulty of separating tocopheroxyl recycling from direct antioxidant actions of other antioxidants has complicated interpretation of the available data. A two-electron redox cycle involving alpha-tocopherol oxidation to 8a-substituted tocopherones followed by tocopherone reduction to alpha-tocopherol may occur, but would require enzymatic catalysis in vivo. Metabolism of antioxidant-inactive alpha-tocopheryl esters releases alpha-tocopherol, whereas reductive metabolism of alpha-tocopherylquinone, an alpha-tocopherol oxidation product, yields alpha-tocopherylhydroquinone, which also may provide antioxidant protection.},

This injurious effect is, in some instances, due to oxidation of the lipid moiety of the lipoprotein. The objectives of this study were to determine if the oxidation rendering the lipoprotein toxic to human skin fibroblasts occurred by free radical mechanisms, and if so, which of the common free radical oxygen species were involved. The selective free radical blockers or scavengers employed included superoxide dismutase for superoxide, catalase for hydrogen peroxide, dimethylfuran for singlet molecular oxygen, and mannitol for hydroxyl radical. The presence during lipoprotein preparation of general free radical scavengers (vitamin E, butylated hydroxytoluene) or the divalent cation chelator ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid prevented the formation of cytotoxic low density lipoprotein, while the simultaneous presence of superoxide dismutase and catalase partially inhibited its formation. The results indicate that superoxide and/or hydrogen peroxide are involved in the formation of the toxic LDL lipid. The toxic action of oxidized LDL could not be prevented by inclusion of antioxidants in the culture medium, indicating that an oxidized lipid was responsible for cell injury rather than free radicals generated in culture by the action of oxidized LDL. Three separate assays for cell injury (enumeration of attached cells, cell loss of lactate dehydrogenase into the culture medium, and trypan blue uptake) indicated a sequence of events in which the fibroblasts are injured, die, and then detach.},

Likewise, the importance of the food matrix on the absorption and metabolism of vitamin C is closely related to the range of the health benefits attributed to its intake. However, less beneficial effects were derived when purified compounds were administered in comparison to the ingestion of horticultural products such as Brassicas, which entail a closely relation between this food matrix and the bioavailability of its content in vitamin C. This fact should be here also discussed. These vegetables of immature flowers or leaves are used as food stuffs all over the world and represent a considerable part of both western and non-Western diets, being inexpensive crops widely spread and reachable to all social levels, constituting an important source of dietary vitamin C, which may work synergistically with the wealth of bioactive compounds present in these foods.},

	abstract = {The literature on the content and stability of vitamin C (ascorbic acid, AA) in citrus juices in relation to industrial practices is reviewed. The role of vitamin C from citrus juices in human diet is also reviewed. Citrus fruits and juices are rich in several types of bioactive compounds. Their antioxidant activity and related benefits derive not only from vitamin C but also from other phytochemicals, mainly flavonoids. During juice processing, temperature and oxygen are the main factors responsible for vitamin C losses. Non-thermal processed juices retain higher levels of vitamin C, but economic factors apparently delay the use of such methods in the citrus industry. Regarding packing material, vitamin C in fruit juice is quite stable when stored in metal or glass containers, whereas juice stored in plastic bottles has a much shorter shelf-life. The limiting step for vitamin C absorption in humans is transcellular active transport across the intestinal wall where AA may be oxidized to dehydroascorbic acid (DHAA), which is easily transported across the cell membrane and immediately reduced back to AA by two major pathways. AA bioavailability in the presence of flavonoids has yielded controversial results. Whereas flavonoids seem to inhibit intestinal absorption of AA, some studies have shown that AA in citrus extract was more available than synthetic ascorbic acid alone. DHAA is reported to possess equivalent biological activity to AA, so recent studies often consider the vitamin C activity in the diet as the sum of AA plus DHAA. However, this claimed equivalence should be carefully reexamined. Humans are one of the few species lacking the enzyme (L-gulonolactone oxidase, GLO) to convert glucose to vitamin C. It has been suggested that this is due to a mutation that provided a survival advantage to early primates, since GLO produces toxic H2O2. Furthermore, the high concentration of AA (and DHAA) in neural tissues could have been the key factor that caused primates (vertebrates with relative big brain) to lose the capacity to synthesize vitamin C. Oxidative damage has many pathological implications in human health, and AA may play a central role in maintaining the metabolic antioxidant response. The abundance of citrus juices in the Mediterranean diet may provide the main dietary source for natural vitamin C.},

Reception and transmission of signals across the plasma membrane has been a function generally attributed to transmembrane proteins. In the last three years, however, a growing number of reports have further acknowledged important contributions played by membrane lipids in the process of signal transduction.

Recent findings
In particular, the constituency of membrane lipids can regulate how proteins with SH2 domains and molecules like K-Ras expose their catalytic domains to the cytosol and interact with effectors and second messengers. Recent reports have also shown that the degree of saturation of phospholipids can reduce the activation of certain G-protein coupled receptors, as well as signaling downstream to Toll-like receptor 4 with consequences to NFkB activation and inflammation. Levels of specific gangliosides in the membrane were reported to activate integrins in a cell-autonomous manner affecting tumor cell migration. Furthermore, high resolution of the association of cholesterol with the Smoothened receptor has clarified its participation in sonic hedgehog signaling. These are some of the key advancements that have further propelled our understanding of the broad versatile contributions of membrane lipids in signal transduction.

Summary
As we gain definitive detail regarding the impact of lipid-protein interactions and their consequences to cell function, the options for therapeutic targeting expand with the possibility of greater specificity.},

	abstract = {Drosophila phototransduction is mediated via a G-protein-coupled PLC cascade. Recent evidence, including the demonstration that light evokes rapid contractions of the photoreceptors, suggested that the light-sensitive channels (TRP and TRPL) may be mechanically gated, together with protons released by PLC-mediated PIP2 hydrolysis. If mechanical gating is involved we predicted that the response to light should be influenced by altering the physical properties of the membrane. To achieve this, we used diet to manipulate the degree of saturation of membrane phospholipids. In flies reared on a yeast diet, lacking polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), mass spectrometry showed that the proportion of polyunsaturated phospholipids was sevenfold reduced (from 38 to ∼5\%) but rescued by adding a single species of PUFA (linolenic or linoleic acid) to the diet. Photoreceptors from yeast-reared flies showed a 2- to 3-fold increase in latency and time to peak of the light response, without affecting quantum bump waveform. In the absence of Ca2+ influx or in trp mutants expressing only TRPL channels, sensitivity to light was reduced up to ∼10-fold by the yeast diet, and essentially abolished in hypomorphic G-protein mutants (Gαq). PLC activity appeared little affected by the yeast diet; however, light-induced contractions measured by atomic force microscopy or the activation of ectopic mechanosensitive gramicidin channels were also slowed ∼2-fold. The results are consistent with mechanosensitive gating and provide a striking example of how dietary fatty acids can profoundly influence sensory performance in a classical G-protein-coupled signaling cascade.},

PUFAs are precursors for a plethora of signaling lipids, for which knowledge about synthetic pathways and receptors has accumulated. However, due to their extreme diversity and the ambiguity concerning the identity of their cognate receptors, the roles of PUFA-derived signaling lipids require more investigation. In addition, PUFA functions cannot be explained just as lipid mediator precursors because they are also critical for the regulation of membrane biophysical properties. The presence of PUFAs in membrane lipids also affects the functions of transmembrane proteins and peripheral membrane proteins. Although the roles of PUFAs as membrane lipid building blocks were difficult to analyze, the discovery of lysophospholipid acyltransferases (LPLATs), which are critical for their incorporation, advanced our understanding. Recent studies unveiled how LPLATs affect PUFA levels in membrane lipids, and their genetic manipulation became an excellent strategy to study the roles of PUFA-containing lipids. In this review, we will provide an overview of metabolic pathways regulating PUFAs as lipid mediator precursors and membrane components and update recent progress about their functions. Some issues to be solved for future research will also be discussed.},

	abstract = {The molecular activity of Na,K-ATPase and other P2 ATPases like Ca2+-ATPase is influenced by the lipid environment via both general (physical) and specific (chemical) interactions. Whereas the general effects of bilayer structure on membrane protein function are fairly well described and understood, the importance of the specific interactions has only been realized within the last decade due particularly to the growing field of membrane protein crystallization, which has shed new light on the molecular details of specific lipid–protein interactions. It is a remarkable observation that specific lipid–protein interactions seem to be evolutionarily conserved, and conformations of specifically bound lipids at the lipid–protein surface within the membrane are similar in crystal structures determined with different techniques and sources of the protein, despite the rather weak lipid–protein interaction energy. Studies of purified detergent-soluble recombinant αβ or αβFXYD Na,K-ATPase complexes reveal three separate functional effects of phospholipids and cholesterol with characteristic structural selectivity. The observations suggest that these three effects are exerted at separate binding sites for phophatidylserine/cholesterol (stabilizing), polyunsaturated phosphatidylethanolamine (stimulatory), and saturated PC or sphingomyelin/cholesterol (inhibitory), which may be located within three lipid-binding pockets identified in recent crystal structures of Na,K-ATPase. The findings point to a central role of direct and specific interactions of different phospholipids and cholesterol in determining both stability and molecular activity of Na,K-ATPase and possible implications for physiological regulation by membrane lipid composition.

	abstract = {Ferroptosis is a form of regulated cell death characterized by the iron-dependent accumulation of lipid hydroperoxides to lethal levels. Emerging evidence suggests that ferroptosis represents an ancient vulnerability caused by the incorporation of polyunsaturated fatty acids into cellular membranes, and cells have developed complex systems that exploit and defend against this vulnerability in different contexts. The sensitivity to ferroptosis is tightly linked to numerous biological processes, including amino acid, iron, and polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism, and the biosynthesis of glutathione, phospholipids, NADPH, and coenzyme Q10. Ferroptosis has been implicated in the pathological cell death associated with degenerative diseases (i.e., Alzheimer's, Huntington's, and Parkinson's diseases), carcinogenesis, stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, ischemia-reperfusion injury, and kidney degeneration in mammals and is also implicated in heat stress in plants. Ferroptosis may also have a tumor-suppressor function that could be harnessed for cancer therapy. This Primer reviews the mechanisms underlying ferroptosis, highlights connections to other areas of biology and medicine, and recommends tools and guidelines for studying this emerging form of regulated cell death.},

	abstract = {Vitamin E disappearance is accelerated in cigarette smokers due to their increased oxidative stress and is inversely correlated with plasma vitamin C concentrations. Therefore, we hypothesized that ascorbic acid supplementation (500 mg, twice daily; 2 weeks) would normalize smokers' plasma alpha- and gamma-tocopherol disappearance rates and conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized crossover investigation in smokers (n=11) and nonsmokers (n=13) given a single dose of deuterium-labeled alpha- and gamma-tocopherols (50 mg each d6-RRR-alpha and d2-RRR-gamma-tocopheryl acetate). During the placebo trial, smokers, compared with nonsmokers, had significantly (P{\textless}0.05) greater alpha- and gamma-tocopherol fractional disappearance rates and shorter half-lives. Ascorbic acid supplementation doubled (P{\textless}0.0001) plasma ascorbic acid concentrations in both groups and attenuated smokers', but not nonsmokers', plasma alpha- and gamma-tocopherol (P{\textless}0.05) fractional disappearance rates by 25\% and 45\%, respectively. Likewise, smokers' plasma deuterium-labeled alpha- and gamma-tocopherol concentrations were significantly higher (P{\textless}0.05) at 72 h during ascorbic acid supplementation compared with placebo. Ascorbic acid supplementation did not significantly change (P{\textgreater}0.05) time of maximal or maximal-labeled alpha- and gamma-tocopherol concentrations. Smokers' plasma F2alpha-isoprostanes were approximately 26\% higher than nonsmokers (P{\textgreater}0.05) and were not affected by ascorbic acid supplementation in either group (P{\textgreater}0.05). In summary, cigarette smoking increased plasma alpha- and gamma-tocopherol fractional disappearance rates, suggesting that the oxidative stress from smoking oxidizes tocopherols and that plasma ascorbic acid reduces alpha- and gamma-tocopheroxyl radicals to nonoxidized forms, thereby decreasing vitamin E disappearance in humans.},

Nevertheless, vitamin E is considerably more lipophilic than vitamin C, and in biomembranes has been found to be the more potent antioxidant, particularly with respect to lipid peroxidation; penetration to a precise site in the membrane may be an important feature of the protection against highly reactive radicals6. Tappel has suggested that the two vitamins act synergistically, vitamin E acting as the primary antioxidant and the resulting vitamin E radical then reacting with vitamin C to regenerate vitamin E7. We now report direct observation of this interaction, which we feel may be an important feature in the maintenance of vitamin E levels in tissues.},

It was suggested that each vitamin E could trap two peroxy radicals, whereas vitamin C could trap only one peroxy radical under the reaction conditions employed in this study. When both vitamin E and vitamin C were present, the oxidation was suppressed quite efficiently and the apparent inhibition rate constant was obtained as kinh = 4.0 X 10(5) M-1 s-1. Furthermore, vitamin E remained almost unchanged and only vitamin C was consumed at the initial stage and vitamin E was consumed after vitamin C was exhausted. It was concluded that vitamin E trapped the peroxy radical and the resulting alpha-chromanoxy radical reacted with vitamin C to regenerate vitamin E.},

As in Guns, Germs, and Steel, Diamond traces the fundamental pattern of catastrophe, and weaves an all-encompassing global thesis through a series of fascinating historical-cultural narratives. Collapse moves from the Polynesian cultures on Easter Island to the flourishing American civilizations of the Anasazi and the Maya and finally to the doomed Viking colony on Greenland. Similar problems face us today and have already brought disaster to Rwanda and Haiti, even as China and Australia are trying to cope in innovative ways. Despite our own society’s apparently inexhaustible wealth and unrivaled political power, ominous warning signs have begun to emerge even in ecologically robust areas like Montana.Brilliant, illuminating, and immensely absorbing, Collapse is destined to take its place as one of the essential books of our time, raising the urgent question: How can our world best avoid committing ecological suicide?},

	abstract = {We review the major subglacial till forming processes as presently understood by glacial researchers and define the parameters within which tills are produced and reconcile them with sedimentary end members. Processes of deformation, flow, sliding, lodgement and ploughing coexist at the base of temperate glacier ice and act to mobilize and transport sediment and deposit it as various end members, ranging from glacitectonically folded and faulted stratified material to texturally homogeneous diamicton. The dominance of any one subglacial process varies both spatially and temporally, giving rise to the possibility that a till or complex till sequence contains a superimposed signature of former transportation/deposition at the ice-bed interface. We recommend that, while glacial geologists and geomorphologists should be able to recognize the sedimentary imprints of various subglacial processes, genetic fingerprinting of subglacial tills should be less process-specific and till classification must reflect the range of products encompassed by the subglacial till production continuum. Glacial geologists can presently unequivocally identify: a) glacitectonite (rock or sediment that has been deformed by subglacial shearing/deformation but retains some of the structural characteristics of the parent material); b) subglacial traction till (sediment deposited by a glacier sole either sliding over and/or deforming its bed, the sediment having been released directly from the ice by pressure melting and/or liberated from the substrate and then disaggregated and completely or largely homogenised by shearing); and support the theoretical case for c) melt-out till (sediment released by the melting of stagnant or slowly moving debris-rich glacier ice, and directly deposited without subsequent transport or deformation). Because observations on contemporary glaciers reveal that their beds are most likely to be mosaics of deformation and sliding and warm based and cold based conditions, the patterns of which change temporally and spatially, it is extremely unlikely that subglacial till end members in the geological record will be anything but hybrids produced by the range of processes operative in the subglacial traction zone.},

	abstract = {The Northern Till is a thick ({\textgreater}65m) deformation till underlying some 7500km2 of Southern Ontario, Canada including the Peterborough Drumlin Field. It was deposited below the Lake Ontario ice stream of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. The till rests on glaciotectonized aquifer sediments and consists of multiple beds of till up to 6m thick. These are separated by boulder lags, sometimes in the form of striated pavements, with thin ({\textless}30cm) interbeds of poorly sorted waterlaid sand. The composite till stratigraphy indicates ‘punctuated aggradation’ where the subglacial bed was built up incrementally by the repeated ‘immobilization’ of deforming overpressured till layers. Boulders and sands indicate pauses in subglacial aggradation marked by sluggish sheet flows of water that reworked the top of the underlying till. Interbeds are laterally extensive and correlated using downhole electrical conductivity, core recovery and natural gamma data. A 3-D finite element model (FEFLOW) using data from 200 cored and geophysically logged boreholes, and a large digital water well dataset of 3400 individual records shows that the till functions as a ‘leaky aquitard’ as a consequence of water flow through interbeds. It is proposed that interbeds played a similar role in the subglacial hydraulic system below the Laurentide Ice Sheet by allowing drainage of excess porewater pressures in deforming sediment and promoting deposition of till. This is in agreement with theoretical studies of deforming bed dynamics and observations at modern glaciers where porewater in the deforming layer is discharged into underlying aquifers. In this way, the presence of interbeds may be fundamental in retarding downglacier transport of deforming bed material thereby promoting the build-up of thick subglacial till successions.},

Determining the proper surface geometry and elevation of the LIS is of central importance to estimate global changes in sea-level and atmospheric circulation patterns during the late Pleistocene and Holocene. Despite largely disappearing from the landscape during the late Holocene, LIS remnants are found in the Penny and Barnes ice caps on Baffin Island (Canada) and ongoing permafrost degradation has been exposing relics of the LIS buried along its northern margin since the late Pleistocene. Here, we use the δ18O records of six LIS remnants and the late Pleistocene δ18O-elevation relation to establish ice elevation in their source area during the last glacial maximum (LGM). Contrary to some modeled reconstructions, our findings indicate an asymmetric LIS topography with higher ice on Keewatin Dome ({\textasciitilde}3200 m) and thinner ice in the prairies along the Plains divide (1700–2100 m) during LGM. The resiliency of icy permafrost to past warm intervals preserved relics of the LIS; these ice-marginal landscapes, now poised for thaw, should uncover more valuable clues about the conditions of the last major ice sheet on Earth.},

Rapid sediment entrainment producing thick debris-rich basal zones may occur by regelation into subglacial materials, and by freeze-on from rising supercooled waters. Numerous other mechanisms may be important but primarily near ice margins, especially those of advancing or fluctuating glaciers. Several sediment-entrainment mechanisms may be active beneath a single glacier, but one process is likely to be dominant at any place and time.},

	abstract = {Landscape analysis, mapping, sedimentology, shallow geophysics, and borehole data are integrated to better understand the complex landform-sediment geometries and event sequences of the Oak Ridges Moraine, southern Ontario. A model for the origin of the Oak Ridges Moraine is based on the recognition that the moraine is built on a high-relief, erosional surface (unconformity) consisting of drumlin uplands and a network of deep, steep-walled, interconnected valleys (tunnel channels). The development of the moraine is thought to have occurred in four stages: I, subglacial sedimentation; II, subaqueous fan sedimentation; III, fan to delta sedimentation; IV, ice-marginal sedimentation. The model traces the transition from subglacial to proglacial conditions during moraine formation and examines the order and timing of sedimentation. It is thought that the early stages of moraine construction are better exposed in the east; in the west, these stages are buried by later stages.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a synthesis of traditional and recently published work regarding the origin and evolution of the Great Lakes. It differs from previously published reviews by focusing on three topics critical to the development of the Great Lakes: the glaciation of the Great Lakes watershed during the late Cenozoic, the evolution of the Great Lakes since the last glacial maximum, and the record of lake levels and coastal erosion in modern times. The Great Lakes are a product of glacial scour and were partially or totally covered by glacier ice at least six times since 0.78 Ma. During retreat of the last ice sheet large proglacial lakes developed in the Great Lakes watershed. Their levels and areas varied considerably as the oscillating ice margin opened and closed outlets at differing elevations and locations; they were also significantly affected by channel downcutting, crustal rebound, and catastrophic inflows from other large glacial lakes. Today, lake level changes of about a 1/3 m annually, and up to 2 m over 10 to 20 year time periods, are mainly climatically-driven. Various engineering works provide small control on lake levels for some but not all the Great Lakes. Although not as pronounced as former changes, these subtle variations in lake level have had a significant effect on shoreline erosion, which is often a major concern of coastal residents.},
