This plant has a large deep taproot (upwards of 4 m) and large spade-like leaves oriented vertically and within 15° of north presumably to maximize total carbon gain (i.e. photosynthesis) and minimizes water loss (<b>Smith</b> and <b>Ullberg</b> 1989). The flowers have multiple (~20) bright yellow <b>ray florets</b> and upwards of 140 central <b>disc florets</b> (Note: most florets are staminate and few produce actual seeds). <b>COSEWIC</b> (2024) estimates that there are only nine extant sub-populations of this species in Canada, most being found within Essex county (Note: population size within Lambton county currently unknown). Based on a 2022 and 2023 COSEWIC survey the total number of mature plants is just over 12,000, with <b>OPC</b> accounting for ~29% of this total (<b>COSEWIC</b> 2024).</span>

This plant has clasping, lance-like “wrinkled” looking leaves that are arranged opposite each other along the length of the central hairy stem. The plant also has dense clusters of tiny white flower heads situated atop the foliage (<b>Kirk</b> and <b>Belt</b> 2008). First Nations People traditionally used the plant for treating fever associated diseases, such as influenza and malaria. Apparently the name <b>Boneset</b> stems from its use in the treatment of dengue fever, which is often referred to as “<i>break-bone fever</i>” (<b>Kirk</b> and <b>Belt</b> 2008, <b>Hensel</b> et al. 2011).</span>

The relatively small elliptical leaves (i.e. usually a trio of leaflets) bear a prominent central vein and have smooth even margins (i.e. <b>entire</b>). They are attached to a hairy central stem in an alternating pattern via a small <b>petiole</b> and also give off a slight silvery sheen due to their closely pressed tiny hairs. The pea shaped flowers are white with purple markings and form distinctive round clusters atop each stem. The flowers attracts many pollinating insects and the seeds provide food for wildlife (e.g. bobwhite, quail).

The plant grows as a single erect unbranched stem (upwards of 1.83 m) with multiple lance-shaped leaves that become narrower and smaller as they alternate upwards along the stem. The <b>phyllaries</b> (i.e. outer leaf-like structures of the flower, also known as bracts) are noticeably irregular or <u>rough</u>-looking along its borders (hence the name). The stalk-less, button-like flower head contains multiple (upwards of 40) pink-purple star-like tubular <b>disc florets</b>. Each of 25 or more florets sport a long stringy style protruding from its centre, giving it a fuzzy brush-like appearance. As one would expect these beautiful flowers provide food for a variety of pollinating insects (e.g. honeybees, bumblebees, butterflies) and hummingbirds (<b>Brakie</b> 2018). Surprisingly neither COSEWIC nor the Ontario ministry of natural resources have any habitat regulations in place to protect this critically imperilled species (<span id="Dred">S1</span>).</span>

The simple lance-like leaves of this plant grow smaller as you ascend toward the inflorescence. They are also arranged in an alternating pattern along the stem. Each flower head produces upwards of 21 yellow <b>ray florets</b> that frame multiple (potentially 100s) tiny yellow <b>disc florets</b>. The aster attracts many pollinating insects (e.g. bees, butterflies) which it depends upon to distribute its pollen. Although the common name of this plant is a bit of a misnomer (i.e. doesn’t cause fall allergies) it was reportedly used by First Nations People to induce sneezing (e.g. treatment of head colds). However, all parts of the plant are toxic due to the presence of <b><a class="one" href="https://opc-project.netlify.app/project/pnps/" target="_blank" title="Go to PNP">sesquiterpene lactones</a></b> such as <b><a class="one" href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Helenalin" target="_blank" title="Go to PubChem">helenalin</a></b> (<b>Drogosz</b> and <b>Janecka</b> 2018, Trull 2024).

This low lying slender stemmed plant has many spreading branches with simple narrow, lance-like leaves. The five pink-purplish petals are fused forming a tube-like structure, with the lips of each lobe spreading outwards. Two yellow lines and multiple dark purple spots mark the interior of the flower. The corolla’s upper section is also softly hairy, or <b>pilose</b>, which partially hides two long and two short stamens (i.e. <b>didynamous</b>) that crowd around a slightly longer blunt tipped style (see inset). Like other members of the <i>Orobanchaceae</i> family <i>A. purpurea</i> is hemi-parasitic and actively siphons nutrients from the roots of neighbouring plants using specialized root structures called <b>haustoria</b> (<b>Riopel</b> and <b>Musselman</b> 1979, <b>Baird</b> and <b>Riopel</b> 1983). As <b>Blanchan</b> (1917) so poetically put it “<i>…When robbery becomes flagrant, Nature brands sinners in the vegetable kingdom by taking away their color, and perhaps their leaves, as in the case of the broom-rape and Indian Pipe; but the fair faces of the gerardias and

The relatively large blue, five petal flower (inset shows a white variant) has a distinct two-lipped <b>zygomorphic</b> structure (i.e. one plane of symmetry, namely bilaterally symmetrical). The base of the flower forms a tube, with the exterior appearing striped.

The plant’s upper flowering stem has a characteristic downy appearance (tiny white hairs). These relatively tall somewhat flimsy plants have very distinct <b>zygomorphic</b> flowers with four white (slightly pinkish) petals, eight yellow anther tipped stamens, and a single slightly longer central style with a noticeably knobby tip (stigma). These beautiful delicate flowers attract many pollinating insects when in bloom just before the start of Fall.</span>

<h3>
GLOBAL & REGIONAL RANKINGS
</h3>

</div>

**GRANKS** (**G**, global rankings) and **SRANKS** (**S**, State/Province rankings) provide designations for floral and ecosystem abundance. They are assigned and maintained by several conservation agencies. The following general rankings are from **<a class="one" href="https://explorer.natureserve.org/AboutTheData/DataTypes/ConservationStatusCategories" target="_blank" title="Go to NatureServe">NatureServe</a>**:  
<span id="Red">GX: Presumed Extinct/Collapsed</span>: **Species** <u>presumed extinct</u>, not located despite intensive searches and virtually no likelihood of rediscovery. **Ecosystem** <u>presumed collapsed</u> throughout its range, due to loss of key dominant and characteristic taxa and/or elimination of the sites and ecological processes on which the type depends.  
<span id="Red">GH - Possibly Extinct/Collapsed</span>: **Species** or **Ecosystem** is known from only historical occurrences, but still some hope of rediscovery. Examples of evidence include (1) that a species has not been documented in approximately 20-40 years in human-dominated landscapes despite some searching and/or some evidence of significant habitat loss or degradation; (2) that a species or ecosystem has been searched for unsuccessfully, but not thoroughly enough to presume that it is extinct or collapsed throughout its range.  
<span id="Dred">G1 - Critically Imperiled</span>: At very high risk of extinction or collapse due to very restricted range, very few populations or occurrences, very steep declines, very severe threats, or other factors.  
<span id="Or">G2 - Imperilled</span>: At high risk of extinction or collapse due to restricted range, few populations or occurrences, steep declines, severe threats, or other factors.  
<span id="Gold">G3 - Vulnerable</span>: At moderate risk of extinction or collapse due to a fairly restricted range, relatively few populations or occurrences, recent and widespread declines, threats, or other factors.  
<span id="Blue">G4 - Apparently Secure</span>: At fairly low risk of extinction or collapse due to an extensive range and or many populations or occurrences, but with possible cause for some concern as a result of local recent declines, threats, or other factors.  
<b>G5 - Secure</b>: At very low risk or extinction or collapse due to a very extensive range, abundant populations or occurrences, and little to no concern from declines or threats.

**GRANK**s and **SRANK**s may also include other designations, notably: **GU** (uncertain global ranking); **G?** (tentative ranking); **Q** (questionable taxonomic status of the species, subspecies, or variety); **T** (rank applies to a subspecies or variety); and **HYB** (hybrid of 2 species); **SH** (plant historically occurred in Ontario, but has not been recorded in the last 20 years); **SR** (plant has been reported without persuasive documentation); **SU** (species has no SRANK value and therefore of uncertain status); **SX** (species apparently extirpated from Ontario with little likelihood of rediscovery); **SE** (species is exotic, not native to Ontario); **?** (some uncertainty about an assigned rank). Rank ranges (e.g. <span id="Dred">S1</span><span id="Or">S2</span>) indicate the uncertain nature of the species rank (i.e. either <span id="Dred">S1</span> or <span id="Or">S2</span>).
