The showy blue-to-violet coloured flower is composed of 3 downward-curving <b>sepals</b> (&ldquo;<i>falls</i>&rdquo;), and 3 shorter erect <b>petals</b> (&ldquo;<i>standards</i>&ldquo;). Closely perched on top of each <b>sepal</b> is a slightly shorter and less colourful <b>style arm</b> that hides the <b>anther</b> (i.e. male part containing pollen). The wide <b>sepal</b> tips serve as landing pads for bees that then travel between the <b>sepal</b> and roof-like <b>style arm</b> towards the nectar at the centre of the flower. Guided by the hairy yellow central line the bees inevitably become &ldquo;dusted&rdquo; with pollen. Although the roots are poisonous to humans <b>Gilmore</b> (1919) mentions that First Nations People used parts of the plant as medicine. Specifically the &ldquo;<i>...rootstock was pulverized and mixed with water, or more often with saliva, and the infusion dropped into the ear to cure earache; it was used also to medicate eye-water. A paste was made to apply to sores and bruises.</i>&rdquo;</span></p></div>

The leaves of the plant have a very distinctive palmate shape with several radiating leaflets. Ecologically the plant serves as an important food resource for the larval stage of many butterfly species, including the globally endangered <b>Karner blue</b> (i.e. <i>Plebejus samuelis</i> caterpillars feed exclusively on lupine leaves).</span></p></div>

The brilliant golden flowers of this petit plant sports six petal-like structures, or <b>tepals</b>, that are arranged in two whorls, as well as six showy arrow-shaped yellow anthers. According to <b>Zong-Xin Ren</b> et al. (2019) these flowers do not produce nectar leaving pollen as the only reward for pollinators (i.e. mostly female native bees). The plant itself can be found in moist meadows and open wooded areas. Occasional one can come across variants that have white flowers (see lower insert).</span></p></div>

<div align=center><h3>GLOBAL & REGIONAL RANKINGS</h3></div>

**GRANKS** (**G**, global rankings) and **SRANKS** (**S**, State/Province rankings) provide designations for floral and ecosystem abundance. They are assigned and maintained by several conservation agencies. The following general rankings are from **<a class="one" href="https://explorer.natureserve.org/AboutTheData/DataTypes/ConservationStatusCategories" target="_blank" title="Go to NatureServe">NatureServe</a>**:  
<span id="Red">GX: Presumed Extinct/Collapsed</span>: **Species** <u>presumed extinct</u>, not located despite intensive searches and virtually no likelihood of rediscovery. **Ecosystem** <u>presumed collapsed</u> throughout its range, due to loss of key dominant and characteristic taxa and/or elimination of the sites and ecological processes on which the type depends.  
<span id="Red">GH - Possibly Extinct/Collapsed</span>: **Species** or **Ecosystem** is known from only historical occurrences, but still some hope of rediscovery. Examples of evidence include (1) that a species has not been documented in approximately 20-40 years in human-dominated landscapes despite some searching and/or some evidence of significant habitat loss or degradation; (2) that a species or ecosystem has been searched for unsuccessfully, but not thoroughly enough to presume that it is extinct or collapsed throughout its range.  
<span id="Dred">G1 - Critically Imperiled</span>: At very high risk of extinction or collapse due to very restricted range, very few populations or occurrences, very steep declines, very severe threats, or other factors.  
<span id="Or">G2 - Imperilled</span>: At high risk of extinction or collapse due to restricted range, few populations or occurrences, steep declines, severe threats, or other factors.  
<span id="Gold">G3 - Vulnerable</span>: At moderate risk of extinction or collapse due to a fairly restricted range, relatively few populations or occurrences, recent and widespread declines, threats, or other factors.  
<span id="Blue">G4 - Apparently Secure</span>: At fairly low risk of extinction or collapse due to an extensive range and or many populations or occurrences, but with possible cause for some concern as a result of local recent declines, threats, or other factors.  
<b>G5 - Secure</b>: At very low risk or extinction or collapse due to a very extensive range, abundant populations or occurrences, and little to no concern from declines or threats.  

**GRANK**s and **SRANK**s may also include other designations, notably: **GU** (uncertain global ranking); **G?** (tentative ranking); **Q** (questionable taxonomic status of the species, subspecies, or variety); **T** (rank applies to a subspecies or variety); and **HYB** (hybrid of 2 species); **SH** (plant historically occurred in Ontario, but has not been recorded in the last 20 years); **SR** (plant has been reported without persuasive documentation); **SU** (species has no SRANK value and therefore of uncertain status); **SX** (species apparently extirpated from Ontario with little likelihood of rediscovery); **SE** (species is exotic, not native to Ontario); **?** (some uncertainty about an assigned rank). Rank ranges (e.g. <span id="Dred">S1</span><span id="Or">S2</span>) indicate the uncertain nature of the species rank (i.e. either <span id="Dred">S1</span> or <span id="Or">S2</span>).
