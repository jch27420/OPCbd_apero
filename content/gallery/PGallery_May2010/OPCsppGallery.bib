	abstract = {Root hemiparasitic plants both compete with and extract resources from host plants. By reducing the abundance of dominant plants and releasing subordinates from competitive exclusion, they can have an outsized impact on plant communities. Most research on the ecological role of hemiparasites is manipulative and focuses on a small number of hemiparasitic taxa. Here, we ask whether patterns in natural plant communities match the expectation that hemiparasites affect the structure of plant communities. Our data were collected on 129 national park units spanning the continental United States. The most common hemiparasite genera were Pedicularis, Castilleja, Krameria, and Comandra. We used null models and linear mixed models to determine whether hemiparasites were associated with changes in community richness and evenness. Hemiparasite presence did not affect community metrics. Hemiparasite abundance was positively associated with increasing evenness of herbaceous species, but not with species richness. The associations that we observed on a continental scale are consistent with evidence that the impacts of root hemiparasitic plants on evenness can be substantial and abundance dependent but that effects on richness are less pronounced. Hemiparasites mediate competitive exclusion in communities to facilitate species coexistence and merit consideration of inclusion in ecological theories of coexistence.},

Hemiparasites are assumed to be weak competitors for light but strong parasites, leading to the prediction that effects on hosts and communities should be a function of resource supply. We investigated the effects of light and mineral nutrients on hemiparasite-host relations in two experiments. Removal of the hemiparasite, addition of fertilizer, and full sun significantly increased total aboveground dry mass in small plots on a restored tallgrass prairie. After 3 years, removal of Pedicularis canadensis almost doubled the mass of grasses and had smaller effects on forb species, but the impact of the parasite was independent of resource level. Fertilizer increased grass growth only in full sun, increased non-legume forb growth only when shade was applied, and tended to depress legume growth when shaded. Light manipulation did not affect the hemiparasite across 4 years of manipulation but fertilizer increased P. canadensis shoot mass. A complementary greenhouse experiment with Andropogon gerardii as host produced qualitatively similar effects and showed that shade reduced root growth of both the host and the parasite. These results do not support common assumptions regarding hemiparasite-host relations under field conditions but indicate that a small hemiparasite can significantly affect prairie productivity regardless of resource supply.},

Are root hemiparasites more associated with species-rich vegetation than other species? Location Czech Republic. Methods Plot size-corrected species richness, Shannon diversity and Pielou's evenness were computed for a representative set of 18 101 vegetation plots representing all main types of terrestrial open (non-forest) habitats of the country. Null models of species richness assuming occurrence of a random species with given occurrence frequency, reflecting higher incidence probability in species-rich plots, were constructed for 16 common root hemiparasitic species. The null model distribution of species richness was subsequently compared with the actual mean species richness of plots containing the respective root hemiparasites. Median values of plot Shannon diversity and evenness were computed for each species in the database. Values obtained for plots containing individual root hemiparasites were compared with distribution of values for other species in the database. Results The occurrence of 11 of 16 root hemiparasites studied was associated with high species richness significantly more than under random expectations; three species were negatively associated. Three root hemiparasites were among the top 5\% of all species associated with high species richness and Shannon diversity, and eight were among the top 25\%. Almost 50\% of the top 1\% most species-rich plots contained at least one root hemiparasitic species. Conclusions We demonstrated a positive association between the incidence of most root hemiparasites and diversity of non-forest terrestrial plant communities at a broad landscape scale. This finding scales up the results of experimental studies that showed some root hemiparasites act as ecosystem engineers, increasing vegetation diversity. Root hemiparasites should be regarded as important biodiversity indicators and potential drivers of biodiversity. As such, conserving their wild populations or promoting their establishment should become a goal of nature conservation and ecological restoration.},

Natural resource managers are interested in utilizing these species as “pseudograzers” in grasslands to reduce competitively dominant grasses and thereby increase ecological diversity and quality in prairie restorations and urban plantings. We performed an observational field study at 5 tallgrass prairie sites to investigate the association of hemiparasite abundance with metrics of phylogenetic and ecological diversity, as well as floristic quality.

Overall, host species biomass as a total community was significantly reduced in mesocosms, consistent with other investigations that demonstrate influence on community structure by hemiparasitic plant species. Although hemiparasites were not acting as pseudograzers, they have the potential to influence community structure in grassland restorations and remnants.},

Soc. 132: 401–410. 2005.—Pedicularis canadensis (lousewort) is a hemiparasitic plant of open woodland and prairie habitats. The interactions between this hemiparasitic plant and selected members of a tallgrass prairie community were investigated via a greenhouse experiment and field observations in a restored prairie. The greenhouse experiment examined interactions between P. canadensis and hosts from each of three families prominent in prairie communities: big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii, Poaceae), tall goldenrod (Solidago canadensis, Asteraceae), and showy tick trefoil (Desmodium canadense, Fabaceae). Individual hemiparasites were grown with one host, with two hosts of a single species, or with two hosts of different species, in all combinations. P. canadensis reduced tall goldenrod shoot mass, marginally affected big bluestem shoot mass, and had no effect on root mass of these two host species or on shoot and root mass of showy tick trefoil. The presence of the hemiparasite did not alter competitive relationships between host species and its effect was similar to that of a competitor. Spearman rank correlations were calculated between P. canadensis cover and species richness and abundances, including bare ground, for Six-Mile Creek Prairie, a restored tallgrass prairie in McLean County, Illinois. Species richness was positively correlated with increasing P. canadensis cover. These results suggest P. canadensis can influence prairie community composition.},

	abstract = {The alpine biome, above the natural tree line, is home to distinctive biotas that can tolerate harsh environmental conditions, and is especially sensitive to the impacts of global warming. However, the actual timeframe during which alpine floras began to appear on a global scale remains unknown. Here, we used Anemone (c. 200 species), an herbaceous plant genus inhabiting a variety of habitats from lowland to high-alpine zone across multiple continents, to obtain new insights into the historical assembly of this biome. Using nuclear ITS and plastid atpB-rbcL, trnL-F, matK, and rbcL sequences, we built a phylogeny that includes 159 individuals of 146 extant Anemone species and 19 outgroups. Within this phylogenetic framework, we estimated divergence times, reconstructed ancestral ranges, and inferred the evolutionary shifts in habitat types. Phylogenetic analyses strongly support the non-monophyletic Anemone, in which the Clematis-Anemoclema clade is nested. Two subgenera of Anemone, subg. Anemone and subg. Anemonidium, are strongly supported as monophyletic. Except for Anemone sect. Keiskea, whose Anemone deltoidea is grouped with A. sect. Hepatica, the other seven sections of this genus are monophyletic. Anemone originated in East Asian non-alpine habitats around 31 Ma, but range expansion and habitat shifts from non-alpine to alpine mainly occurred after the Miocene Climatic Optimum (c. 14 Ma). The alpine Anemone lineages in different biogeographic regions originated near-synchronously, beginning in the middle Miocene (c. 16–12 Ma). We also found that the other alpine floristic elements across multiple continents emerged roughly at the same time. Our findings suggest that the rise of global alpine floras is near-synchronous and began in the middle Miocene, possibly in association with the mid-Miocene global cooling and regional orogenetic activities. The mid-late Miocene is an essential period for the assembly and evolution of global alpine floras. The alpine floristic diversity comprises pre-adapted immigrants from other alpine zones through long-distance dispersal and descendants from local lowland ancestors, as well as from other regional lowland ancestors to a lesser extent.},

	abstract = {Species-rich grasslands have high conservation value because they support diverse floral and faunal assemblages. Alpine grassland is an important and characteristic ecosystem of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, but ca. 30 \% has been severely degraded by the combined effects of climate change, human activity, overgrazing and rodent damage. One potential method to restore grassland diversity involves using hemiparasitic plants to modify the competitive relationships among neighboring species. A possible candidate is Pedicularis kansuensis, a hemiparasitic plant found in grasslands throughout the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, but more information on its host associations and its effects on surrounding vegetation is required to assess its suitability. Thus, we examined host associations of P. kansuensis by direct root excavation at a selected site on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and found that haustoria formation is non-randomly distributed among host species, with preferential bias for members of Poaceae, Rosaceae and Fabaceae. We also found that aboveground biomass of grasses and legumes was higher in quadrats from which the parasite had been removed than in intact controls, while the biomass of sedges and forbs was unaffected by parasite removal. However, removal significantly decreased plant species richness and Shannon–Wiener diversity. These results suggest that P. kansuensis modifies the competitive balance in grassland communities of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, allowing for colonization by subordinate species and thereby enhancing species diversity and contributing to restoration of these degraded grasslands.},

	abstract = {This thesis explores the history of food and nutrition in Indigenous communities in mid- to late-twentieth century Canada. It does so through tracing changes in state policies and procedures, as well as Indigenous approaches to foodways, health, and healing from the 1960s into the 1980s. It looks at how shifting discourses of nutrition and food science impacted educational materials and programs for Indigenous peoples, often aimed at mothers and children in Indigenous communities, and highlights a moment of possibility in the early 1980s when Indigenous peoples were increasingly being consulted on and leading state programs tailored to their communities and cultures. It aims to privilege the experiences of Indigenous peoples through the choice of sources and attention to Indigenous methodologies. It therefore includes discussion of Indigenous activism and its impact on health and healing, food production and preparation, land use and agriculture, and data collection used for food and nutrition surveys. Central to this dissertation is the concern that Indigenous peoples have been studied, pathologized, and racialized as part of a long history of settler-colonialism in Canada. Many of the state nutrition projects that informed policies and programs during the period were organized and carried out by non-Indigenous experts and their cadres, with a very top-down approach. These mirror colonial initiatives dating back a century in the most heavily studied regions, singling out Indigenous peoples as a unique category of subjects to be studied separately from the rest of the population. Accordingly, it focuses heavily on Manitoba and the Northwest Territories, regions that were often the focus of Medical Services Branch initiatives. In studying the history of ‘Aboriginal nutrition’ as a growing field of expertise during the period, this dissertation challenges narratives of decline, dispossession, and displacement of Indigenous peoples that have dominated Canadian history. It contributes to the growing literature that works instead to centre Indigenous peoples and their experiences of modernity, in this case their foodways and nutritional knowledge. It does so by exploring gender, food, and emotions as categories of historical analysis helpful in peeling back the layered relationships between Indigenous peoples and representatives of the state.},

However, the Atlantis fritillary and Aphrodite fritillary have experienced severe population declines within the last few decades. We created ecological niche models for these five species by combining each species’ known occurrences with climate and environmental variables to identify important response variables and determine the potential distribution of suitable habitat for each species. Important climate variables differed among species, although minimum temperature of the coldest month was important for great spangled, Atlantis, and Aphrodite fritillaries. The regal fritillary responded the most to temperature seasonality, whereas the Diana fritillary responded to maximum temperature of warmest month and the great spangled fritillary responded to annual precipitation. Land use was important for all species except the regal fritillary and average annual relative humidity was important for all species except the great spangled fritillary. This study highlights the different climate and habitat needs for greater fritillary species with important implications for how each species is expected to be impacted by climate change. We also demonstrate the value of citizen science and photo sharing websites for providing important data for evaluating species distributions.},

The present extensive literature survey revealed Viola species to be a group of important nutritional and medicinal plants used for the ethnomedicinal treatment of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes, asthma, lung diseases, and fatigue. Many plant species of this genus have also received scientific validation of their pharmacological activities including neuroprotective, immunomodulatory, anticancer, antihypertensive, antidyslipidemic, analgesic, antipyretic, diuretic, anti-inflammatory, anthelmintic, and antioxidant. Viola is highly rich in different natural products some of which have been isolated and identified in the past few decades; these include flavonoids terpenoids and phenylpropanoids of different pharmacological activities. The pharmacokinetics and clinical studies on this genus are lacking, and the present review is aimed at summarizing the current understanding of the ethnopharmacology, phytochemistry, nutritional composition, and pharmacological profile of medicinal plants from the Viola genus to reveal its therapeutic potentials, gaps, and subsequently open a new window for future pharmacological research.},

	abstract = {Floriculture and horticulture have always been two parallel and very distinct agronomic realities. Floriculture is concerned with meeting the ornamental needs of our urban ecosystems, while horticulture is based on meeting food requirements. These two activities have now converged toward a food chain where flowers are conceived of as a sort of “new vegetable” and one of the most promising novelties to satisfy the growing need for food innovation both in terms of an organoleptic and nutraceutical profile. This novelty has rapidly evolved, especially following the growing scientific evidence of the human health benefits of flowers used as food. The typically high pigment concentration of the corollas (especially flavonoids and carotenoids), which have evolved to chromatically attract pollinators, indicates a marked nutraceutical activity especially in terms of antioxidant power. In this review, we first attempted to explore which species are most promising and which should be avoided due to real or suspected toxicity problems. The nutraceutical virtues were therefore highlighted trying to focus attention on those “functional phytochemicals” capable of counteracting some specific human pathologies. Furthermore, the organoleptic profile of edible flowers was investigated since this is one of the least known aspects. The cropping systems suitable for their cultivation were therefore hypothesized and finally the criticalities of edible flowers were addressed in terms of shelf life and marketing opportunities.},

	abstract = {We compared the floral ecology and pollen–pistil interactions in Hypoxis hirsuta (L.) Coville from North America and Hypoxis aurea Loureiro from China. Both species are vernal-flowering herbs, with yellow perianths, providing pollen as their only reward. In H. hirsuta, hand self-pollinated, emasculated and bagged control flowers failed to set fruit. When cross-pollinated, 77\% of the pistils produced seed-filled capsules while 72\% of open, insect-pollinated flowers set seed. Epifluorescence showed that most germinating grains failed to penetrate the stigmatic surface {\textgreater} 24 h after hand self-pollination suggesting early-acting self-incompatibility (SI). The majority of pollinators of H. hirsuta were female bees representing 21 species distributed in four families. Pollen load analyses indicated that most bees were polylectic and carried grains of H. hirsuta mixed with pollen of co-blooming, nectariferous species. In contrast, capsule production of H. aurea was 60\% for open, insect-pollinated flowers. Pollen tubes of H. aurea also entered ovules within 24 h, and SI of this species was partial. Evidence of a late-acting rejection in this species following self-pollination included abnormal growth of pollen tubes in styles with fewer tubes penetrating ovules. In contrast, abnormal tube growth was not observed in styles of H. hirsuta. Hypoxis aurea received fewer insect visitations. Pollen was dispersed primarily by hoverflies (Syrphidae) followed by bees. Floral presentation, generalist pollination and two modes of SI found in these two Hypoxis species contribute to our understanding of floral evolution for congeners isolated on different continents.},
