	abstract = {Cardenolides are classically studied steroidal defenses in chemical ecology and plant-herbivore coevolution. Although milkweed plants (Asclepias spp.) produce up to 200 structurally different cardenolides, all compounds seemingly share the same well-characterized mode of action, inhibition of the ubiquitous Na(+)/K(+) ATPase in animal cells. Over their evolutionary radiation, milkweeds show a quantitative decline of cardenolide production and diversity. This reduction is contrary to coevolutionary predictions and could represent a cost-saving strategy, i.e. production of fewer but more toxic cardenolides. Here we test this hypothesis by tandem cardenolide quantification using HPLC (UV absorption of the unsaturated lactone) and a pharmacological assay (in vitro inhibition of a sensitive Na(+)/K(+) ATPase) in a comparative study of 16 species of Asclepias. We contrast cardenolide concentrations in leaf tissue to the subset of cardenolides present in exuding latex. Results from the two quantification methods were strongly correlated, but the enzymatic assay revealed that milkweed cardenolide mixtures often cause stronger inhibition than equal amounts of a non-milkweed reference cardenolide, ouabain. Cardenolide concentrations in latex and leaves were positively correlated across species, yet latex caused 27\% stronger enzyme inhibition than equimolar amounts of leaf cardenolides. Using a novel multiple regression approach, we found three highly potent cardenolides (identified as calactin, calotropin, and voruscharin) to be primarily responsible for the increased pharmacological activity of milkweed cardenolide mixtures. However, contrary to an expected trade-off between concentration and toxicity, later-diverging milkweeds had the lowest amounts of these potent cardenolides, perhaps indicating an evolutionary response to milkweed's diverse community of specialist cardenolide-sequestering insect herbivores.},

	abstract = {The extent of convergent molecular evolution is largely unknown, yet is critical to understanding the genetics of adaptation. Target site insensitivity to cardenolides is a prime candidate for studying molecular convergence because herbivores in six orders of insects have specialized on these plant poisons, which gain their toxicity by blocking an essential transmembrane carrier, the sodium pump (Na,K-ATPase). We investigated gene sequences of the Na,K-ATPase alpha-subunit in 18 insects feeding on cardenolide-containing plants (spanning 15 genera and four orders) to screen for amino acid substitutions that might lower sensitivity to cardenolides. The replacement N122H that was previously shown to confer resistance in the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) and Chrysochus leaf beetles was found in four additional species, Oncopeltus fasciatus and Lygaeus kalmii (Heteroptera, Lygaeidae), Labidomera clivicollis (Coleoptera, Chrysomelidae), and Liriomyza asclepiadis (Diptera, Agromyzidae). Thus, across 300 Myr of insect divergence, specialization on cardenolide-containing plants resulted in molecular convergence for an adaptation likely involved in coevolution. Our screen revealed a number of other substitutions connected to cardenolide binding in mammals. We confirmed that some of the particular substitutions provide resistance to cardenolides by introducing five distinct constructs of the Drosophila melanogaster gene into susceptible eucaryotic cells under an ouabain selection regime. These functional assays demonstrate that combined substitutions of Q(111) and N(122) are synergistic, with greater than twofold higher resistance than either substitution alone and \{\vphantom{\}}{\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash}12-fold resistance over the wild type. Thus, even across deep phylogenetic branches, evolutionary degrees of freedom seem to be limited by physiological constraints, such that the same molecular substitutions confer adaptation.},

	abstract = {Cardenolides are remarkable steroidal toxins that have become model systems, critical in the development of theories for chemical ecology and coevolution. Because cardenolides inhibit the ubiquitous and essential animal enzyme Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase, most insects that feed on cardenolide-containing plants are highly specialized. With a huge diversity of chemical forms, these secondary metabolites are sporadically distributed across 12 botanical families, but dominate the Apocynaceae where they are found in \{\vphantom{\}}{\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash} 30 genera. Studies over the past decade have demonstrated patterns in the distribution of cardenolides among plant organs, including all tissue types, and across broad geographic gradients within and across species. Cardenolide production has a genetic basis and is subject to natural selection by herbivores. In addition, there is strong evidence for phenotypic plasticity, with the biotic and abiotic environment predictably impacting cardenolide production. Mounting evidence indicates a high degree of specificity in herbivore-induced cardenolides in Asclepias. While herbivores of cardenolide-containing plants often sequester the toxins, are aposematic, and possess several physiological adaptations (including target site insensitivity), there is strong evidence that these specialists are nonetheless negatively impacted by cardenolides. While reviewing both the mechanisms and evolutionary ecology of cardenolide-mediated interactions, we advance novel hypotheses and suggest directions for future work.},

	abstract = {Although plant-defense theory has long predicted patterns of chemical defense across taxa, we know remarkably little about the evolution of defense, especially in the context of directional phylogenetic trends. Here we contrast the production of phenolics and cardenolides in 35 species of milkweeds (Asclepias and Gomphocarpus). Maximum-likelihood analyses of character evolution revealed three major patterns. First, consistent with the defense-escalation hypothesis, the diversification of the milkweeds was associated with a trend for increasing phenolic production; this pattern was reversed (a declining evolutionary trend) for cardenolides, toxins sequestered by specialist herbivores. Second, phylogenetically independent correlations existed among phenolic classes across species. For example, coumaric acid derivatives showed negatively correlated evolution with caffeic acid derivatives, and this was likely driven by the fact that the former are used as precursors for the latter. In contrast, coumaric acid derivatives were positively correlated with flavonoids, consistent with competition for the precursor p-coumaric acid. Finally, of the phenolic classes, only flavonoids showed correlated evolution (positive) with cardenolides, consistent with a physiological and evolutionary link between the two via malonate. Thus, this study presents a rigorous test of the defense-escalation hypothesis and a novel phylogenetic approach to understanding the long-term persistence of physiological constraints on secondary metabolism.},

By reducing the abundance of dominant plants and releasing subordinates from competitive exclusion, they can have an outsized impact on plant communities. Most research on the ecological role of hemiparasites is manipulative and focuses on a small number of hemiparasitic taxa. Here, we ask whether patterns in natural plant communities match the expectation that hemiparasites affect the structure of plant communities. Our data were collected on 129 national park units spanning the continental United States. The most common hemiparasite genera were Pedicularis, Castilleja, Krameria, and Comandra. We used null models and linear mixed models to determine whether hemiparasites were associated with changes in community richness and evenness. Hemiparasite presence did not affect community metrics. Hemiparasite abundance was positively associated with increasing evenness of herbaceous species, but not with species richness. The associations that we observed on a continental scale are consistent with evidence that the impacts of root hemiparasitic plants on evenness can be substantial and abundance dependent but that effects on richness are less pronounced. Hemiparasites mediate competitive exclusion in communities to facilitate species coexistence and merit consideration of inclusion in ecological theories of coexistence.},

Hemiparasites are assumed to be weak competitors for light but strong parasites, leading to the prediction that effects on hosts and communities should be a function of resource supply. We investigated the effects of light and mineral nutrients on hemiparasite-host relations in two experiments. Removal of the hemiparasite, addition of fertilizer, and full sun significantly increased total aboveground dry mass in small plots on a restored tallgrass prairie. After 3 years, removal of Pedicularis canadensis almost doubled the mass of grasses and had smaller effects on forb species, but the impact of the parasite was independent of resource level. Fertilizer increased grass growth only in full sun, increased non-legume forb growth only when shade was applied, and tended to depress legume growth when shaded. Light manipulation did not affect the hemiparasite across 4 years of manipulation but fertilizer increased P. canadensis shoot mass. A complementary greenhouse experiment with Andropogon gerardii as host produced qualitatively similar effects and showed that shade reduced root growth of both the host and the parasite. These results do not support common assumptions regarding hemiparasite-host relations under field conditions but indicate that a small hemiparasite can significantly affect prairie productivity regardless of resource supply.},

Are root hemiparasites more associated with species-rich vegetation than other species? Location Czech Republic. Methods Plot size-corrected species richness, Shannon diversity and Pielou's evenness were computed for a representative set of 18 101 vegetation plots representing all main types of terrestrial open (non-forest) habitats of the country. Null models of species richness assuming occurrence of a random species with given occurrence frequency, reflecting higher incidence probability in species-rich plots, were constructed for 16 common root hemiparasitic species. The null model distribution of species richness was subsequently compared with the actual mean species richness of plots containing the respective root hemiparasites. Median values of plot Shannon diversity and evenness were computed for each species in the database. Values obtained for plots containing individual root hemiparasites were compared with distribution of values for other species in the database. Results The occurrence of 11 of 16 root hemiparasites studied was associated with high species richness significantly more than under random expectations; three species were negatively associated. Three root hemiparasites were among the top 5\% of all species associated with high species richness and Shannon diversity, and eight were among the top 25\%. Almost 50\% of the top 1\% most species-rich plots contained at least one root hemiparasitic species. Conclusions We demonstrated a positive association between the incidence of most root hemiparasites and diversity of non-forest terrestrial plant communities at a broad landscape scale. This finding scales up the results of experimental studies that showed some root hemiparasites act as ecosystem engineers, increasing vegetation diversity. Root hemiparasites should be regarded as important biodiversity indicators and potential drivers of biodiversity. As such, conserving their wild populations or promoting their establishment should become a goal of nature conservation and ecological restoration.},

Soc. 132: 401–410. 2005.—Pedicularis canadensis (lousewort) is a hemiparasitic plant of open woodland and prairie habitats. The interactions between this hemiparasitic plant and selected members of a tallgrass prairie community were investigated via a greenhouse experiment and field observations in a restored prairie. The greenhouse experiment examined interactions between P. canadensis and hosts from each of three families prominent in prairie communities: big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii, Poaceae), tall goldenrod (Solidago canadensis, Asteraceae), and showy tick trefoil (Desmodium canadense, Fabaceae). Individual hemiparasites were grown with one host, with two hosts of a single species, or with two hosts of different species, in all combinations. P. canadensis reduced tall goldenrod shoot mass, marginally affected big bluestem shoot mass, and had no effect on root mass of these two host species or on shoot and root mass of showy tick trefoil. The presence of the hemiparasite did not alter competitive relationships between host species and its effect was similar to that of a competitor. Spearman rank correlations were calculated between P. canadensis cover and species richness and abundances, including bare ground, for Six-Mile Creek Prairie, a restored tallgrass prairie in McLean County, Illinois. Species richness was positively correlated with increasing P. canadensis cover. These results suggest P. canadensis can influence prairie community composition.},

	abstract = {The alpine biome, above the natural tree line, is home to distinctive biotas that can tolerate harsh environmental conditions, and is especially sensitive to the impacts of global warming. However, the actual timeframe during which alpine floras began to appear on a global scale remains unknown. Here, we used Anemone (c. 200 species), an herbaceous plant genus inhabiting a variety of habitats from lowland to high-alpine zone across multiple continents, to obtain new insights into the historical assembly of this biome. Using nuclear ITS and plastid atpB-rbcL, trnL-F, matK, and rbcL sequences, we built a phylogeny that includes 159 individuals of 146 extant Anemone species and 19 outgroups. Within this phylogenetic framework, we estimated divergence times, reconstructed ancestral ranges, and inferred the evolutionary shifts in habitat types. Phylogenetic analyses strongly support the non-monophyletic Anemone, in which the Clematis-Anemoclema clade is nested. Two subgenera of Anemone, subg. Anemone and subg. Anemonidium, are strongly supported as monophyletic. Except for Anemone sect. Keiskea, whose Anemone deltoidea is grouped with A. sect. Hepatica, the other seven sections of this genus are monophyletic. Anemone originated in East Asian non-alpine habitats around 31 Ma, but range expansion and habitat shifts from non-alpine to alpine mainly occurred after the Miocene Climatic Optimum (c. 14 Ma). The alpine Anemone lineages in different biogeographic regions originated near-synchronously, beginning in the middle Miocene (c. 16–12 Ma). We also found that the other alpine floristic elements across multiple continents emerged roughly at the same time. Our findings suggest that the rise of global alpine floras is near-synchronous and began in the middle Miocene, possibly in association with the mid-Miocene global cooling and regional orogenetic activities. The mid-late Miocene is an essential period for the assembly and evolution of global alpine floras. The alpine floristic diversity comprises pre-adapted immigrants from other alpine zones through long-distance dispersal and descendants from local lowland ancestors, as well as from other regional lowland ancestors to a lesser extent.},

	abstract = {Species-rich grasslands have high conservation value because they support diverse floral and faunal assemblages. Alpine grassland is an important and characteristic ecosystem of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, but ca. 30 \% has been severely degraded by the combined effects of climate change, human activity, overgrazing and rodent damage. One potential method to restore grassland diversity involves using hemiparasitic plants to modify the competitive relationships among neighboring species. A possible candidate is Pedicularis kansuensis, a hemiparasitic plant found in grasslands throughout the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, but more information on its host associations and its effects on surrounding vegetation is required to assess its suitability. Thus, we examined host associations of P. kansuensis by direct root excavation at a selected site on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and found that haustoria formation is non-randomly distributed among host species, with preferential bias for members of Poaceae, Rosaceae and Fabaceae. We also found that aboveground biomass of grasses and legumes was higher in quadrats from which the parasite had been removed than in intact controls, while the biomass of sedges and forbs was unaffected by parasite removal. However, removal significantly decreased plant species richness and Shannon–Wiener diversity. These results suggest that P. kansuensis modifies the competitive balance in grassland communities of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, allowing for colonization by subordinate species and thereby enhancing species diversity and contributing to restoration of these degraded grasslands.},

	abstract = {This thesis explores the history of food and nutrition in Indigenous communities in mid- to late-twentieth century Canada. It does so through tracing changes in state policies and procedures, as well as Indigenous approaches to foodways, health, and healing from the 1960s into the 1980s. It looks at how shifting discourses of nutrition and food science impacted educational materials and programs for Indigenous peoples, often aimed at mothers and children in Indigenous communities, and highlights a moment of possibility in the early 1980s when Indigenous peoples were increasingly being consulted on and leading state programs tailored to their communities and cultures. It aims to privilege the experiences of Indigenous peoples through the choice of sources and attention to Indigenous methodologies. It therefore includes discussion of Indigenous activism and its impact on health and healing, food production and preparation, land use and agriculture, and data collection used for food and nutrition surveys. Central to this dissertation is the concern that Indigenous peoples have been studied, pathologized, and racialized as part of a long history of settler-colonialism in Canada. Many of the state nutrition projects that informed policies and programs during the period were organized and carried out by non-Indigenous experts and their cadres, with a very top-down approach. These mirror colonial initiatives dating back a century in the most heavily studied regions, singling out Indigenous peoples as a unique category of subjects to be studied separately from the rest of the population. Accordingly, it focuses heavily on Manitoba and the Northwest Territories, regions that were often the focus of Medical Services Branch initiatives. In studying the history of ‘Aboriginal nutrition’ as a growing field of expertise during the period, this dissertation challenges narratives of decline, dispossession, and displacement of Indigenous peoples that have dominated Canadian history. It contributes to the growing literature that works instead to centre Indigenous peoples and their experiences of modernity, in this case their foodways and nutritional knowledge. It does so by exploring gender, food, and emotions as categories of historical analysis helpful in peeling back the layered relationships between Indigenous peoples and representatives of the state.},

Iroquoian agriculturalists of southern Ontario cultivated corn, beans, squash, tobacco, and sunflowers, and gathered the greatest variety of food plants. Southern and eastern Algonkian hunters and gatherers ate a wide variety of wild plant foods including fleshy fruits, nuts, greens, and underground parts. Little is known about the use of wild food plants by northern Cree and Naskapi.Nutritional data for gathered plants indicate that many of these species exceed conventional plant sources for vitamins and minerals. Vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, iron, and fibre are particularly well represented in certain gathered plants. Some wild plant foods require special preparation or must be consumed in limited quantities because they contain toxic secondary metabolites.Over 400 plants are used in native medicine. Native medicine consists of rational and ritualistic components. Treatment of physical disorders, whose origin could be determined, was effective. At least 105 medicinal plants have a real effectiveness based on phytochemical constituents. Conifers were the most widely used group of plants in this category. Antibiotic monoterpenes, polyacetylenes and alkaloids, astringent tannins, and analgesic monoterpenes and salicylates are among the most rationally and widely used plant constituents.There is need for more research into nutritional constituents and pharmacological properties to assess the value and potential of plants used by Native People of eastern Canada.},

Contemporary medicine has demonstrated many potential health benefits of berries due to their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity. Indigenous Peoples have not only utilized berries as food, likely over many centuries, but have also passed down knowledge on the medicinal uses of various parts of these plants including the fruits, leaves and roots.

The regal fritillary and Diana fritillary are species of concern, whereas the great spangled fritillary, Atlantis fritillary, and Aphrodite fritillary are relatively abundant within their respective ranges. However, the Atlantis fritillary and Aphrodite fritillary have experienced severe population declines within the last few decades. We created ecological niche models for these five species by combining each species’ known occurrences with climate and environmental variables to identify important response variables and determine the potential distribution of suitable habitat for each species. Important climate variables differed among species, although minimum temperature of the coldest month was important for great spangled, Atlantis, and Aphrodite fritillaries. The regal fritillary responded the most to temperature seasonality, whereas the Diana fritillary responded to maximum temperature of warmest month and the great spangled fritillary responded to annual precipitation. Land use was important for all species except the regal fritillary and average annual relative humidity was important for all species except the great spangled fritillary. This study highlights the different climate and habitat needs for greater fritillary species with important implications for how each species is expected to be impacted by climate change. We also demonstrate the value of citizen science and photo sharing websites for providing important data for evaluating species distributions.},

	abstract = {Floriculture and horticulture have always been two parallel and very distinct agronomic realities. Floriculture is concerned with meeting the ornamental needs of our urban ecosystems, while horticulture is based on meeting food requirements. These two activities have now converged toward a food chain where flowers are conceived of as a sort of “new vegetable” and one of the most promising novelties to satisfy the growing need for food innovation both in terms of an organoleptic and nutraceutical profile. This novelty has rapidly evolved, especially following the growing scientific evidence of the human health benefits of flowers used as food. The typically high pigment concentration of the corollas (especially flavonoids and carotenoids), which have evolved to chromatically attract pollinators, indicates a marked nutraceutical activity especially in terms of antioxidant power. In this review, we first attempted to explore which species are most promising and which should be avoided due to real or suspected toxicity problems. The nutraceutical virtues were therefore highlighted trying to focus attention on those “functional phytochemicals” capable of counteracting some specific human pathologies. Furthermore, the organoleptic profile of edible flowers was investigated since this is one of the least known aspects. The cropping systems suitable for their cultivation were therefore hypothesized and finally the criticalities of edible flowers were addressed in terms of shelf life and marketing opportunities.},

Both species are vernal-flowering herbs, with yellow perianths, providing pollen as their only reward. In H. hirsuta, hand self-pollinated, emasculated and bagged control flowers failed to set fruit. When cross-pollinated, 77\% of the pistils produced seed-filled capsules while 72\% of open, insect-pollinated flowers set seed. Epifluorescence showed that most germinating grains failed to penetrate the stigmatic surface {\textgreater} 24 h after hand self-pollination suggesting early-acting self-incompatibility (SI). The majority of pollinators of H. hirsuta were female bees representing 21 species distributed in four families. Pollen load analyses indicated that most bees were polylectic and carried grains of H. hirsuta mixed with pollen of co-blooming, nectariferous species. In contrast, capsule production of H. aurea was 60\% for open, insect-pollinated flowers. Pollen tubes of H. aurea also entered ovules within 24 h, and SI of this species was partial. Evidence of a late-acting rejection in this species following self-pollination included abnormal growth of pollen tubes in styles with fewer tubes penetrating ovules. In contrast, abnormal tube growth was not observed in styles of H. hirsuta. Hypoxis aurea received fewer insect visitations. Pollen was dispersed primarily by hoverflies (Syrphidae) followed by bees. Floral presentation, generalist pollination and two modes of SI found in these two Hypoxis species contribute to our understanding of floral evolution for congeners isolated on different continents.},

Ecological observations of permanently marked stands made over a ten-year period have shown that growth is highly variable from year to year, and flowering and seed set are sporadic and unpredictable. Germination studies have determined that seed viability is very high. Greenhouse-raised plants have been successfully transplanted to the field and followed for three years. Transplants have also been used in a forbs garden, where plants could be monitored more effectively.

	abstract = {Life history differences among seven species of Asclepias (A. exaltata, A. incarnata, A. purpurascens, A. syriaca, A. tuberosa, A. verticillata and A. viridiflora) in south-east Michigan are correlated with differences in microhabitat, in exposure to herbivores, and in competition. Components of each species' reproductive strategy include: number of stems per plants, number of umbels per stem, number of flowers and pods per umbel, number of seeds per pod, seed weight and annual increase in reproductive potential. Components of each species' selective regime include: the herbivore load (measured by the frequency of plants damaged by predators or animal parasites), competition (measured by the proportion of non-flowering plants and by the density of competitors), and environmental uncertainty (measured by annual mortality rates). The study involved observation of 3482 individually labelled plants during portions of three growing seasons. The seven species are long-lived perennials and have a common pollination system and mechanism of dispersal. Within this adaptive zone the species have a variety of mechanisms of seed production adjusted to the pattern of herbivore damage and opportunities for seedling establishment. A. exaltata is a woodland species with a high herbivore load and low annual reproductive output, but with a remarkable ability to withstand herbivore damage from deer and the chrysomelid beetle Labidomera clivicollis. Asclepias incarnata is a wetland species with relatively low annual survival due to erosion of pond banks; seedling densities are often very high and each plant produces many pods, each with a few large seeds. A. purpurascens is rare in the study area; it is similar to A. exaltata but has more seeds per pod. A. syriaca is a ubiquitous weed of open upland habitats and is the only species with vegetative propagation. It has many seeds in each pod and a prolonged flowering season. The cerambycid beetle Tetraopes tetrophthalmus and the weevil Rhyssomatus have a coevolved relationship with Asclepias syriaca. A. tuberosa invades the highly diverse and stable old-field forb community. Once established this species has a very high annual survival, virtually no herbivore load, and low annual seed output. A. viridiflora is widely distributed in old-field habitats. It has a heavy herbivore load, long flowering season and large seed crop. A. verticillata occurs in scattered colonies on dry open hillsides. It has a long flowering season, low herbivore load, long prereproductive period and a large crop of small seeds. This study demonstrates that interpretations of the evolution of reproductive patterns should involve considerations of herbivore loads and environmental uncertainty as well as competition and the growth trajectory of the population.},

Stands were ordered along a recognized moisture–substrate gradient divided into four segments; dry-mesic sandy, mesic sandy loam, wet-mesic sandy loam, and wet loam. Many species showed preferences for certain regions of the gradient. Species richness ranged between 44 and 91 species per stand. The composition of the vegetation was summarized for the four segments, using prevalent species lists. Effectiveness of the direct gradient analysis was assessed by ordination using reciprocal averaging and polar ordination. Percent sand, percent organic matter, and depth of A horizon were significant correlates of the primary axis. Frequent burning of the prairie by the Indians has effectively maintained these prairies. The composition of the Walpole Island prairies is similar to those in Michigan, Illinois, and Wisconsin, forming part of the eastern tallgrass prairie.},

	doi = {10.1111/mec.16450},
	abstract = {Coevolution between plants and herbivores often involves escalation of defence-offence strategies, but attack by multiple herbivores may obscure the match of plant defence to any one attacker. As herbivores often specialize on distinct plant parts, we hypothesized that defence-offence interactions in coevolved systems may become physiologically and evolutionarily compartmentalized between plant tissues. We report that roots, leaves, flower buds and seeds of the tropical milkweed (Asclepias curassavica) show increasing concentrations of cardenolide toxins acropetally, with latex showing the highest concentration. In vitro assays of the physiological target of cardenolides, the Na+ /K+ -ATPase (hereafter "sodium pump"), of three specialized milkweed herbivores (root-feeding Tetraopes tetrophthalmus, leaf-feeding Danaus plexippus, and seed-feeding Oncopeltus fasciatus) show that they are proportionally tolerant to the cardenolide concentrations of the tissues they eat. Indeed, molecular substitutions in the insects' sodium pumps predicted their tolerance to toxins from their target tissues. Nonetheless, the relative inhibition of the sodium pumps of these specialists by the concentration versus composition (inhibition controlled for concentration, what we term "potency") of cardenolides from their target versus nontarget plant tissues revealed different degrees of insect adaptation to tissue-specific toxins. In addition, a trade-off between toxin concentration and potency emerged across plant tissues, potentially reflecting coevolutionary history or plant physiological constraints. Our findings suggest that tissue-specific coevolutionary dynamics may be proceeding between the plant and its specialized community of herbivores. This novel finding may be common in nature, contributing to ways in which coevolution proceeds in multispecies communities.},

All of these insects are thought to be warningly coloured. The cardenolide content of Tetraopes, in contrast with other milkweed herbivores such as the lygaeid bugs Oncopeltus fasciatus and Lygaeus kalmii, appears to be limited by physiological factors, rather than the cardenolide content of the host plant. Cardenolides were not detected in the pupae of an arctiid moth which has an aposematic larva, a cryptic grasshopper, or a cryptic plant hopper, all of which fed on milkweeds known to contain cardenolides. The implication for chemical defense and the position of these insects in mimicry complexes is briefly discussed. It appears that few of the principal milkweed-feeding insects in temperate North America may use host-derived cardenolides as a chemical defense strategy.},

	abstract = {Beetles in the genus Tetraopes share a long evolutionary history with milkweeds (Asclepias spp.), feeding on roots as larvae and leaves as adults. Despite their extreme specialization on milkweed, Tetraopes require drying grass stems as oviposition sites, even though they do not consume grass. The natural history of the interaction suggests that herbivory may be likely only when milkweeds are in close proximity to grasses. Theory also predicts that two stresses on plants, competition and herbivory, may have non-additive negative impacts on correlates of fitness. In field experiments conducted over two years, I followed the consequences of grass competition and beetle attack for herbivory, growth, and reproduction of milkweed, and reciprocal effects of milkweed on grass in common gardens. To assess the effect of milkweed traits on beetles, I conducted a quantitative genetic experiment using full-sibling families of milkweed and measured the effects of putative resistance traits on the abundance of Tetraopes adults. Milkweeds growing next to grass were initially unaffected in growth but suffered 10\% greater leaf herbivory by adult Tetraopes than did milkweeds growing alone. This effect was caused by direct attraction of beetles to grass, not by a competitive modification of milkweed's phenotype. In late summer of the first growing season, when Tetraopes naturally oviposits, I experimentally added larvae to milkweed roots with and without grass competition. Within a month, I detected an interaction between competition and herbivory: neither had an individual impact, but jointly they reduced milkweed growth. In spring of the second growing season, when Tetraopes had completed development, I again found strong evidence for a non-additive effect of competition and herbivory together, severely reducing plant growth compared to their individual effects. Root herbivory induced a plant response that reduced the abundance of leaf-mining flies by 40\%, but only for milkweeds with grass competition. Neither competition nor herbivory affected the production of defensive latex, cardenolides, or carbon, but they interacted to affect leaf nitrogen content. Thus, although trait-mediated indirect interactions were implicated in the effect of competition and root herbivory on leaf miner abundance, I did not uncover the mechanism. In the final harvest, beetle herbivory reduced reproductive characters (fruit production, fruit mass, aboveground biomass) by 20– 30\%, whereas competition had negligible effects. The net interaction effect for grass was competitive, with a 23\% reduction in grass biomass caused by milkweed in the absence of herbivory. However, the presence of beetle herbivory on milkweed roots completely alleviated the competitive effect of milkweed on grass. Thus, the associational effect of grass on milkweed resulted in milkweed suffering the non-additive effects of competition and herbivory, whereas grass enjoyed competitive release by facilitating its neighbor's herbivore. Many traits of milkweed (e.g., growth, reproduction, and several resistance traits) showed variation among 23 full-sibling families, indicating that competitive ability and resistance may be subject to natural selection. A multiple regression analysis on family means revealed that leaf trichome density and nitrogen content were negatively genetically correlated with abundance of Tetraopes adults, but probability of flowering and plant height were positively associated. Leaf miners were most strongly negatively affected by latex and trichomes. Thus, complex interactions among competition, root herbivory, and plant genetic variation affect the herbivore and plant community and may result in diffuse coevolution between milkweed and its herbivores. I present a general model that predicts the conditions in which plant–plant interactions result in net competition or facilitation.},

	abstract = {DEFENSIVE mimicry has long been a paradigm of adaptive evolution by natural selection1–3. Mimics, models and predators in a batesian mimicry system (unpalatable model, palatable mimic) exist in a very different selective milieu from those in a müllerian system (involving ≳2 unpalatable 'co-models')1,4–6. Consequently, the incorrect characterization of a mimicry relationship obscures the natural histories of populations involved and undermines attempts to test general mimicry theory by means of empirical studies of specific systems. Here, we reassess the classic case of mimicry involving viceroy butterflies, Limenitis archippus (Cramer) (Nymphalidae), and two species they purportedly mimic: the monarch, Danaus plexippus (L.), and the queen, Danaus gilippus (Cramer) (Nymphalidae: Danainae). Viceroys are historically considered palatable (batesian) mimics7,8 of the chemically defended9 danaines. Our experiment refutes this interpretation by revealing that viceroys are as unpalatable as monarchs, and significantly more unpalatable than queens from representative Florida populations. This implies that viceroys are müllerian co-mimics of the danaines and prompts a comprehensive reassessment of this widely cited exemplar of mimicry.},

Geographic distributions of these two subspecies are roughly coincident with the ranges of the viceroy's two eastern mimicry models: the monarch (Danaus plexippus) in the N, and the queen (D. gilippus) in the S. This coincidence has historically been attributed to “model-switching”: presumably, southern viceroys have switched from mimicking the monarch to mimicking the locally predominant queen, due to selective pressure exerted by visually foraging predators. As an initial test of this hypothesis, I sought evidence of selective predation on light and dark viceroys by captive red-winged blackbirds previously exposed to either monarchs or queens. Results were consistent with the model-switching hypothesis: queen-conditioned birds preferentially avoided the dark, queen-like L. a. floridensis, whereas birds exposed to monarchs avoided (to a lesser degree) the light L. a. archippus phenotype. I propose that this differential predation, while perhaps asymmetrical, demonstrates the selective mechanism responsible for the evolution of regional viceroy races, and that geographic model-switching explains the large-scale modern-day correlation between Danaus biogeography and viceroy wing color.},

	abstract = {Batesian and Müllerian mimicry relationships differ greatly in terms of selective pressures affecting the participants; hence, accurately characterizing a mimetic interaction is a crucial prerequisite to understanding the selective milieux of model, mimic, and predator. Florida viceroy butterflies (Limenitis archippus floridensis) are conventionally characterized as palatable Batesian mimics of distasteful Florida queens (Danaus gilippus berenice). However, recent experiments indicate that both butterflies are moderately distasteful, suggesting they may be Müllerian comimics. To directly test whether the butterflies exemplify Müllerian mimicry, I performed two reciprocal experiments using red‐winged blackbird predators. In Experiment 1, each of eight birds was exposed to a series of eight queens as “models,” then offered four choice trials involving a viceroy (the putative “mimic”) versus a novel alternative butterfly. If mimicry was effective, viceroys should be attacked less than alternatives. I also compared the birds' reactions to solo viceroy “mimics” offered before and after queen models, hypothesizing that attack rate on the viceroy would decrease after birds had been exposed to queen models. In Experiment 2, 12 birds were tested with viceroys as models and queens as putative mimics.The experiments revealed that (1) viceroys and queens offered as models were both moderately unpalatable (only 16\% entirely eaten), (2) some birds apparently developed conditioned aversions to viceroy or queen models after only eight exposures, (3) in the subsequent choice trials, viceroy and queen “mimics” were attacked significantly less than alternatives, and (4) solo postmodel mimics were attacked significantly less than solo premodel mimics. Therefore, under these experimental conditions, sampled Florida viceroys and queens are comimics and exemplify Müllerian, not Batesian, mimicry. This compels a reassessment of selective forces affecting the butterflies and their predators, and sets the stage for a broader empirical investigation of the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of mimicry.},

	abstract = {Supergenes are tight clusters of loci that facilitate the co-segregation of adaptive variation, providing integrated control of complex adaptive phenotypes. Polymorphic supergenes, in which specific combinations of traits are maintained within a single population, were first described for ‘pin’ and ‘thrum’ floral types in Primula and Fagopyrum, but classic examples are also found in insect mimicry– and snail morphology. Understanding the evolutionary mechanisms that generate these co-adapted gene sets, as well as the mode of limiting the production of unfit recombinant forms, remains a substantial challenge–. Here we show that individual wing-pattern morphs in the polymorphic mimetic butterfly Heliconius numata are associated with different genomic rearrangements at the supergene locus P. These rearrangements tighten the genetic linkage between at least two colour-pattern loci that are known to recombine in closely related species–, with complete suppression of recombination being observed in experimental crosses across a 400-kilobase interval containing at least 18 genes. In natural populations, notable patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) are observed across the entire P region. The resulting divergent haplotype clades and inversion breakpoints are found in complete association with wing-pattern morphs. Our results indicate that allelic combinations at known wing-patterning loci have become locked together in a polymorphic rearrangement at the Plocus, forming a supergene that acts as a simple switch between complex adaptive phenotypes found in sympatry. These findings highlight how genomic rearrangements can have a central role in the coexistence of adaptive phenotypes involving several genes acting in concert, by locally limiting recombination and gene flow.},

	abstract = {1 The hemiparasitic Orobanchaceae (ex-Scrophulariaceae) are characterized by a distinctive suite of ecophysiological traits. These traits have important impacts on host plants and non-host plants, and influence interactions with other trophic levels. Ultimately, they can affect community structure and functioning. Here, we review these physiological traits and discuss their ecological consequences. 2 The root hemiparasitic Orobanchaceae form a convenient subset of the parasitic angiosperms for study because: they are the most numerous and most widely distributed group of parasitic angiosperms; their physiological characteristics have been well studied; they are important in both agricultural and (semi)natural communities; and they are tractable as experimental organisms. 3 Key traits include: high transpiration rates; competition with the host for nutrients and haustorial metabolism of host-derived solutes; uptake of host-derived secondary metabolites; dual autotrophic and heterotrophic carbon nutrition; distinct carbohydrate biochemistry; high nutrient concentrations in green leaf tissue and leaf litter; and small (often hairless and non-mycorrhizal) roots. 4 Impacts on the host are detrimental, which can alter competitive balances between hosts and non-hosts and thus result in community change. Further impacts may result from effects on the abiotic environment, including soil water status, nutrient cycling and leaf/canopy temperatures. 5 However, for non-host species and for organisms that interact with these (e.g. herbivores and pollinators) or for those that benefit from changes in the abiotic environment, the parasites may have an overall positive effect, suggesting that at the community level, hemiparasites may also be considered as mutualists. 6 It is clear that through their distinctive suite of physiological traits hemiparasitic Orobanchaceae, have considerable impacts on community structure and function, can have both competitive and positive interactions with other plants, and can impact on other trophic levels. Many community level effects of parasitic plants can be considered analogous to those of other parasites, predators or herbivores.},

Anatomical and developmental studies were undertaken to find evidence for the existence of vestigial or rudimentary parts whose existence would illuminate the true nature of the flower. Vascular and epidermal anatomy of sepals are both similar to that of leaves. Corolla and androecium develop basipetally and petals and stamens share common vascular traces in the lower part of the receptacle.

Fluctuating, balancing, and negative frequency-dependent selection mediated through pollinators have been identified as factors that may contribute to the maintenance of floral-color variation, and recently it has been suggested that indirect responses to selection on correlated characters through agents of selection other than pollinators may substantially shape the evolution of floral traits. Here, I provide empirical support for this latter view in Claytonia virginica (Portulacaceae) through a multiseason field study, a pollen supplementation study, and an artificial herbivory experiment. These studies show that most individuals fall into one of four discrete color classes, and suggest pollinator-mediated selection for increased floral redness in concurrent years. Floral color is also an indirect target of opposing directional selection via herbivores and pathogens that fluctuates through time. Taken together, these data suggest a novel mechanism by which floral-color variation may be maintained, and illustrate the importance of an inclusive, pluralistic view of selection when investigating the evolution of complex phenotypes.},

Sanguinaria canadensis is facultatively autogamous, the Dicentras are obligate outcrossers, and the remainder are self—compatible, at least within a stem. All are insect pollinated except sometimes S. canadensis. The numbers of ovules per flower and flowers per stem tended to be inversely correlated, and large—seeded species (S. canadensis, E. albidum, I. biternatum) had lower numbers of potential seeds per stem than did small—seeded species. Flowering of all species typically occurred during the first prolonged period of weather suitable for pollinator activity and ceased by the time the canopy closed. Annual differences in flowering times were associated with differences in average temperatures (i.e., early blooming in a warm, early spring), but cumulative degree—hours or degree—days of air or soil temperatures were not well correlated with flowering times. Other constraints on flowering phenology are discussed, including the predictability of suitable conditions, a proposed "fail—safe" mechanism that may assure flowering before canopy closure even if temperatures are abnomally low, and the importance of nontemperature factors in defining suitable conditions. Flowering time was not very finely tuned to the temperature regime and pollinator activity; flowers blooming during the flowering peak often had low seed production and the fertilization rate of most species was low. Evidence that seed production may have been pollinator limited for several species was obtained by comparing the success of hand pollination and of natural pollination, rarity of certain specialized pollinators, and estimates of the abortion rates of fertilized ovules. We suggest that flowering in early spring is a high—risk option in terms of insect—mediated sexual reproduction. Certain flower—visiting insects favored D. laciniata out of proportion to its abundance, but no effect on seed set of other species was detectable. Honeybees were abundant and active flower visitors with the potential for disrupting ecological/evolutionary relationships between native insects and flowers.},

Seventy-five percent of leaves measured had an angle of deviation from horizontal of more than 60°, and 60\% were oriented within 15° of North. Incident Photon Flux Density (PFD), leaf temperature, photosynthesis, stomatal conductance to CO2, internal CO2 concentration, transpiration, and water use efficiency (WUE) were measured on 67 pairs of leaves with the axes oriented in either a North-South (N–S) or East–West (E–W) direction. Leaves with axes oriented N–S intercepted higher levels of PFD during morning and afternoon and exhibited higher diurnal rates of photosynthesis and WUE. Leaf temperature was reduced in N–S leaves during midday as compared to E–W leaves, and was lower in vertical leaves than in those in a horizontal position. Therefore, it was concluded that leaf orientation and verticality enhance carbon gain and minimize water loss—characteristics which may have adaptive significance in a hot, stressful prairie environment.},

	abstract = {The azimuth of vertical leaves of Silphium terebinthinaceum profoundly influenced total daily irradiance as well as the proportion of direct versus diffuse light incident on the adaxial and abaxial leaf surface. These differences caused structural and physiological adjustments in leaves that affected photosynthetic performance. Leaves with the adaxial surface facing East received equal daily integrated irradiance on each surface, and these leaves had similar photosynthetic rates when irradiated on either the adaxial or abaxial surface. The adaxial surface of East-facing leaves was also the only surface to receive more direct than diffuse irradiance and this was the only leaf side which had a clearly defined columnar palisade layer. A potential cost of constructing East-facing leaves with symmetrical photosynthetic capcity was a 25\% higher specific leaf mass and increased leaf thickness in comparison to asymmetrical South-facing leaves. The adaxial surface of South-facing leaves received approximately three times more daily integrated irradiance than the abaxial surface. When measured at saturating CO2 and irradiance, these leaves had 42\% higher photosynthetic rates when irradiated on the adaxial surface than when irradiated on the abaxial surface. However, there was no difference in photosynthesis for these leaves when irradiated on either surface when measurements were made at ambient CO2. Stomatal distribution (mean adaxial/abaxial stomatal density = 0.61) was unaffected by leaf orientation. Thus, the potential for high photosynthetic rates of adaxial palisade cells in South-facing leaves at ambient CO2 concentrations may have been constrained by stomatal limitations to gas exchange. The distribution of soluble protein and chlorophyll within leaves suggests that palisade and spongy mesophyll cells acclimated to their local light environment. The protein/chlorophyll ratio was high in the palisade layers and decreased in the spongy mesophyll cells, presumably corresponding to the attentuation of light as it penetrates leaves. Unlike some species, the chlorophyll a/b ratio and the degree of thylakoid stacking was uniform throughout the thickness of the leaf. It appears that sun-shade acclimation among cell layers of Silphium terebinthinaceum leaves is accomplished without adjustment to the chlorophyll a/b ratio or to thylakoid membrane structure.},

	abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Eupatorium perfoliatum L. originates from North America, where it has been widely used since centuries by native Indians. Additionally extracts are used also in Europe as immunostimulating agent for treatment of fever and cold. The following review summarizes published data on phytochemistry, ethnopharmacological use, as well as clinical and preclinical data.
Materials and methods
Literature survey was performed via SciFinder® on papers and patents and by systematic research in ethnopharmacological literature at various university libraries.
Results
The phytochemical composition of Eupatorium perfoliatum is described in detail for volatile oil, caffeic acid derivatives, flavonoids, sesquiterpene lactones, tannins, polysaccharides. Methods for analytical quality control, as well as specification for relevant lead structures can be deduced from published batch analysis. Preclinical studies indicate anti-inflammatory effects of ethanolic extracts, which can be correlated on a molecular level to eupafolin and sesquiterpen lactones. Antiplasmodial, antioxidative and immunomodulating activities are additionally discussed. Clinical data on the use of Eupatorium perfoliatum do not meet modern GCP requirements, but do indicate positive tendencies for use of ethanolic extracts for treatment of common colds.
Conclusion
While the postulated immunostimulating properties of Eupatorium perfoliatum have not been confirmed by in vitro data, animal-studies and in vitro experiments with plant extracts both indicate antiinflammatory effects beside antiplasmodial effect against Plasmodium falciparum. Such an antiinflammation caused by the ethanolic extracts can be correlated well with clinical symptoms related to diseases as common cold, rheumatism, athritis etc. These data also support the plausibility of the plant's traditional use by the North American indigenous population and early European settlers. In principle quality aspects of the herbal material have to be affirmed by establishing modern pharmacopoeial control methods to guarantee constant and reliable quality.},

The search for active compounds yielded seven sesquiterpene lactones: Four structurally similar guaianolides, one dimeric guaianolide, and two germacranolides. The guaianolides differ in the degree of oxidation at C-14, ranging from a hydroxyl group up to a free carboxylic acid. The dimeric guaianolide, structurally closely related to the monomers, displays an unusual type of interguaianolide linkage between C-14 and C-4. Except for the germacranolide euperfolitin, all STLs described here were hitherto unknown. Furthermore, the flavonoid aglycones eupafolin, hispidulin, patuletin, and kaempferol were identified in the extract, which, except for kaempferol, have not been described as constituents of E. perfoliatum before. The dimeric guaianolide was shown to be the most active constituent against Plasmodium falciparum (IC50 = 2.0μM) and was less cytotoxic against rat skeletal myoblasts (IC50 = 16.2μM, selectivity index of about 8).},

The best-known sesquiterpene lactones which are already used as drugs or are used in clinical trials are artemisinin, thapsigargin and parthenolide. Yet another sesquiterpene lactone, helenalin, an active component of Arnica montana, known for its strong anti-inflammatory activity, has been used for centuries in folk medicine to treat minor injuries. Unfortunately, helenalin's ability to cause allergic reactions and its toxicity to healthy tissues prevented so far the development of this sesquiterpene lactone as an anticancer or anti-inflammatory drug. Recently, the new interest in the biological properties, as well as in the synthesis of helenalin analogs has been observed. This review describes helenalin's major biological activities, molecular mechanisms of action, its toxicity and potential for further research.},

Helenalin and its derivatives are known for anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory effects via inhibiting NF-kappaB and telomerase activity and impairing protein and DNA synthesis, suggesting that helenalin is a potential candidate for the treatment of deregulated and unwanted T cell-mediated immune responses. Here we show that helenalin induces apoptosis in activated CD4+ T cells by triggering the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. Induction of apoptosis is accompanied by rapid stabilization of p53, nuclear localization of p53 and AIF, and an increase in ROS production that results in loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim). Activated CD4+ T cells which survive exposure to helenalin undergo inhibition of proliferation by induction of G2/M cell cycle arrest. Cell cycle arrest is accompanied by the accumulation of cell cycle regulator proteins p21(WAF/CIP1), p2(KIP1) and cyclin D2, whereas abundance of cyclin A and B(1) is decreased. Cell surface expression of the activation-associated receptors CD25, CD27, CD28, CD120b as well as production of IL-2 are impaired. Transcriptional activation of genes encoding for CD25, IL-2 and IFN-gamma is mediated by transcription factors of the NFAT family, and we demonstrate that helenalin suppresses nuclear translocation of NFATc2 in activated CD4+ T cells. Thus, helenalin can be defined as a new immunosuppressive compound suited for the treatment of deregulated and unwanted T cell-mediated immune responses.},

Hyaluronan (HA) plays a pivotal role in maintaining homeostasis within articular chondrocytes. Intra-articular supplementation of high molecular weight hyaluronan (HMW-HA) has been widely used in OA treatment. However, its prospective mechanism of action is still unclear. In this study, we examined the suppressive effect of HA on enhanced cathepsin K expression induced by mechanical stress loading. A human chondrocytic HCS-2/8 cells were cultured in silicon chambers and subjected to cyclic tensile stress (CTS) loading. CTS loading significantly increased messenger ribonucleic acid and protein expression of cathepsin K, which appeared to be suppressed by pre-treatment with HMW-HA. Activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) was induced by CTS loading, and suppressed by pre-treatment with HMW-HA. Helenalin, a chemical inhibitor of NF-κB, clearly suppressed the enhanced expression of cathepsin K, as well as NF-κB activation induced by CTS loading. The suppressive effect of HMW-HA on enhanced cathepsin K expression via NF-κB inhibition impacts the effectiveness of HMW-HA in OA treatment. Our findings provide new evidence supporting the biological effectiveness of intra-articular HMW-HA injections for treatment of OA.},

	abstract = {Nutrient availability is one of the critical factors for plant survival and is mediated mainly by the root system. In addition to the roots, some species have evolved novel organs specialized for the acquisition of organic and inorganic nutrients. For example, most legume species form root nodules that accommodate nitrogen-fixing bacteria to acquire fixed nitrogen, whereas carnivorous plants have developed digestive leaves that trap and kill prey to absorb additional nutrients (Markmann and Parniske, 2009; Thorogood et al., 2018). Parasitic plants form a multicellular organ, the haustorium, emanating from either their shoots or roots, to parasitize other plants in order to acquire water and nutrients (Yoshida et al., 2016). Plant parasitism has independently evolved at least 12 times among angiosperms (Westwood et al., 2010). The Orobanchaceae family includes the largest number of parasitic species and all, except the genus Lindenbergia, Rehmannia, and Triaenophora, are root parasitic plants (Angiosperm Phylogeny Group, 2016; Li et al., 2019). Haustorium development proceeds in stages, including initiation, host penetration, and the formation of vascular connections. Recent progress in molecular and cellular biology has revealed that each phase is modulated by specific plant hormones, cellular programs, and signal exchanges between the host and parasite. In this review, we discuss recent updates on the molecular details of haustorium organogenesis in the Orobanchaceae family by focusing on genetic components and signaling molecules that function at each stage of haustorium development.},

Bufotoxins, derivatives of bufadienolides containing polar molecules mainly belonging to argininyl residues, are reviewed as well. The established structures of bufotoxins have been compiled into a one-page figure to review their structures. We also highlighted advances in the structure-modification of the structure of compounds in this class.

This study was performed to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with toad poisoning in Thailand.

Methods
We carried out a retrospective study of patients with toad poisoning from the Ramathibodi Poison Center Toxic Exposure Surveillance System during a 5-year period (2012–2016).

Results
We studied 36 patients poisoned by toad toxin. The median age was 31 years. Most patients were male (66.7\%) and had ingested toad meat (50\%). The most common presentation was gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms with a median onset of 2 h after ingestion. Twelve patients presented with bradycardia; seven presented with shock and one with cardiac arrest. In the initial EKGs of all patients, the most common abnormality was sinus bradycardia.Two patients developed cardiac arrest early during management in the emergency room (within 15 minutes after ER arrival or within 4.5 h after ingestion). During admission, one patient developed sinus bradycardia, and two developed bradyarrhythmia; however, all three were stable. No tachyarrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia were detected in any patient. Some patients (11.1\%) presented with hyperkalemia. Serum digoxin was detected in five of seven patients tested, ranging from 0.43 to {\textgreater}8 ng/mL. Most patients (75\%) were admitted to the hospital; the median duration of hospitalization was 2 d (range 0.5–5 d). The overall mortality rate was 8.3\%, and all three patients that died ate toad meat and/or eggs and developed cardiac arrest. All patients received supportive with/without symptomatic care including GI decontamination, inotropic drugs, cardiac pacing, and management of hyperkalemia. One patient received intravenous calcium for hyperkalemia but did not develop dysrhythmia after calcium administration. One patient received digoxin-specific antibody fragments (DsFab), after which he clinically improved and was discharged.

Conclusion
Toad poisoning commonly caused GI symptoms and bradycardia. However, in severe cases, death occurred. Tachyarrhythmia was not observed. Supportive, symptomatic care might be the main therapies for this poisoning, especially if DsFab is not available.},

The possible occurrence of S. cernua × magnicamporum hybrids was detected at one New York site. These discoveries are from both natural alvar and disturbed meadow and shore sites. The new records suggest that S. magnicamporum occurs more widely than was suspected previously, its presence perhaps masked by its similarity to the common S. cernua (L.) Richard. Eastern occurrences may represent a combination of post-glacial relict populations, responses to climate change, and the results of long-distance dispersal events. These range extensions constitute the most easterly known populations of S. magnicamporum in North America. They also represent new records for New York State (including Jefferson and St. Lawrence Counties) and for the City of Ottawa in Ontario.},

Extensively studied Onconase is in advanced Phase IIIb clinical trials against malignant mesothelioma, while Amphinase is a novel enzyme in pre-clinical development. Onconase is the smallest (104 amino acid residues) member of the ribonuclease A superfamily while Amphinase (114 residues) is the largest among amphibian ribonucleases. Both enzymes share the characteristic frog ribonucleases C-terminal disulfide bond but another signature of this group, the N-terminal pyroglutamate, an integral part of Onconase active site is not conserved in Amphinase., Although Onconase and Amphinase are weak catalysts their enzymatic activities are required for cytostatic and cytotoxic activity. While it was postulated that tRNA is the primary substrate of Onconase in vivo there is also extensive indirect evidence that suggests other RNA species, in particular micro RNAs, may actually be the critical target of these ribonucleases. The cytostatic effects of Onconase and Amphinase are manifested as cell arrest in the G1 cell cycle phase. Apoptosis then follows involving activation of endonucleases(s), caspases, serine proteases and transglutaminase. Onconase was shown to be strongly synergistic when combined with numerous other antitumor modalities. Onconase and Amphinase are highly cationic molecules and their preferential toxicity towards cancer cells (having distinctly higher negative charge compared to normal cells) may depend on increased binding efficiency to the cell surface by electrostatic interactions., Here we will discuss the structures of Onconase and Amphinase and the molecular basis for their enzymatic and anticancer functions.},

The putative mechanism for ranpirnase-mediated cytotoxicity involves binding to anionic components of the extracellular membrane, cytosolic internalization, and degradation of transfer RNA leading to apoptosis. The maintenance of ribonucleolytic activity in the presence of the cytosolic ribonuclease inhibitor protein is a key aspect of the cytotoxic activity of ranpirnase. The basis for its specific toxicity for cancer cells is not known. This review describes the development of ranpirnase as a cancer chemotherapeutic agent.},

	abstract = {Besides Onconase (ONC) and its V11/N20/R103-variant, oocytes of the Northern Leopard frog (Rana pipiens) contain another homologue of ribonuclease A, which we named Amphinase (Amph). Four variants (Amph-1-4) were isolated and sequenced, each 114 amino acid residues in length and N-glycosylated at two positions. Sequence identities (a) among the variants and (b) versus ONC are 86.8-99.1\% and 38.2-40.0\%, respectively. When compared with other amphibian ribonucleases, a typical pattern of cysteine residues is evident but the N-terminal pyroglutamate residue is replaced by a six-residue extension. Amph variants have relatively weak ribonucleolytic activity that is insensitive to human ribonuclease inhibitor protein (RI). Values of k(cat)/K(M) with hypersensitive fluorogenic substrates are 10(4) and 10(2)-fold lower than the maximum values exhibited by ribonuclease A and ONC, respectively, and there is little cytosine/uracil or adenine/guanine discrimination at the B(1) or B(2) subsites, respectively. Amph variants have cytotoxic activity toward A-253 carcinoma cells that requires intact ribonucleolytic activity. The glycan component has little or no influence over single-stranded RNA cleavage, RI evasion or cytotoxicity. The crystal structures of natural and recombinant Amph-2 (determined at 1.8 and 1.9 A resolution, respectively) reveal that the N terminus is unlikely to play a catalytic role (but an unusual alpha2-beta1 loop may do so) and the B(2) subsite is rudimentary. At the active site, structural features that may contribute to the enzyme's low ribonucleolytic activity are the fixture of Lys14 in an obstructive position, the accompanying ejection of Lys42, and a lack of constraints on the conformations of Lys42 and His107.},

Dermal exposures with minimal symptoms were treated at home with the supportive measures of hair and spine removal, irrigation, antihistamine, and/or topical steroid administration. Symptom resolution occurred within 24 hours. Symptomatic patients with oral exposures and positive visualization of hairs or spines, were referred to an emergency department for medical evaluation and removal of the caterpillar hairs. Adult exposure and treatment patterns were similar to the pediatric exposures. Removal of the defensive guard hairs or spines is the primary treatment. Supportive care with irrigation, antihistamines, and/or corticosteroids can decrease the intensity of symptoms. (Am J Emerg Med 2001;19: 396-398. Copyright © 2001 by W.B. Saunders Company)},

Metabolic conversion of the allyl group gives rise to intermediates capable of covalent binding with DNA and protein, and recent findings are compatible with conversion of the methylenedioxy group to a carbene, which forms ligand complexes with the haem moiety of cytochromes P-450 and P-448. It is suggested that while the allyl group is responsible for the mutagenic potential of safrole, the methylenedioxy moiety may be associated with epigenetic aspects of carcinogenicity.},
