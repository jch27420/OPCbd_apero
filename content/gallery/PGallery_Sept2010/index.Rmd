This very beautiful vibrant blue flower sadly only blooms during the last year of its two year life cycle. The delicately fringed petals are held aloft by triangular shaped green sepals at the base of the flower. As <b>Neltje Blanchan</b> (1917) so aptly put it &ldquo;<i>When we come upon a bed of gentians...we can but repeat <b><a class="one" href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/55340/to-the-fringed-gentian" target="_blank" title="Go to PoetryFoundation">Bryants</a></b> thoughts and express them prosaically who attempt description</i>&rdquo;.</span></p></div>

The stem is brown or grayish brown and slightly hairy, although the upper stem sections may lack hairs (i.e. glabrescent). The simple, sessile, alternately arranged narrow grayish-green leaves become noticeably smaller as you ascend the plant or branch, and often have a small white-spine tip (see inset). The crowded flower set (i.e. inflorescence) forms a multi-branched panicle-like structure that contains many (potentially 200 or more) flower heads. Each flower head consists of multiple (10-18) white <b>ray florets</b> and upwards of 20 yellow <b>disc florets</b> (become brown). The smaller flowers and spine-less <b>phyllaries</b> (leaf like bracts at the base of the flower) helps distinguish it from the similar looking <i>S. pilosum</i>, or <b>Hairy aster</b> (<b>Wennerberg</b> 2004).</span></p></div>

This smaller bluestem has bluish or grayish-green leaves and stalks that become noticeably reddish or coppery in colour during the fall season. The upper stalks sport fluffy slightly curving <b>spikelets</b> (i.e. <b>awn</b> is the bristly extension of the outer flower or <b>lemma</b> that aids seed dispersal). Ecologically it is one of the main grasses found in the tallgrass prairies of the central plains, and it also provides food and shelter for the larva of many butterfly species (<b>USDA</b> 2002, <b>Tober</b> and <b>Jensen</b> 2013).</span></p></div>

Although it is usually associated with the western-central Great Plains, there are rare isolated populations further east, particularly in and around the lower Great Lakes (<b>Catling</b> 1976, <b>Reddoch</b> et. al. 2013, <b>Brunton</b> 2015). You will likely detect its strong vanilla-like odour (i.e. likely coumarin compounds) before setting eyes on the distinctive spiralling spike of creamy white flowers. Each flower head has a ruffled, protruding lower lip that is tinted yellow along its back central line, and horn-like lateral sepals.</span></p></div>

It usually has a dorsal green colour highlighted by numerous (lightly ringed) dark brownish spots, and two parallel tan coloured dorso-lateral folds running from the back of the eye down the back. Like many frogs it dines on a variety of insects and other small animals. Research has identified novel RNA based enzymes (i.e. ribonucleases) from the oocytes of <i>L. pipiens</i> that may be used as a cancer chemotherapeutic agent (<b>Lee</b> and <b>Raines</b> 2008, <b>Ardelt</b> et. al. 2008).</span></p></div>

The plant has very distinct deep purple flowers, each containing upwards of 100 <b>ray florets</b> and 50 or more central yellow <b>disc florets</b>. The erect central stem and smaller upper branches are purplish in colour and fairly hairy (i.e. <b>pilose</b>). The lance-shaped leaves are clasping (i.e. no petiole) and arranged in an alternating pattern along the stems. Like many asters it is an important food source for both pollinating insects (i.e. butterflies, moths, ants, flies, and bees) and seed eating songbirds (<b>Moore</b> 2003).</span></p></div>

This white fluffy caterpillar sequesters toxic chemicals from its food to ward off predators. Exposure to the stings of this larva can trigger somewhat mild skin irritation in both infants and adults (<b>Kuspis</b> 2001).</span></p></div>

The plant's compound leaves consist of three leaflets (see inset), one oriented along the leaf axis and two smaller one mirroring each other on opposite sides of the leaf stalk. The blade of each leaflet is triangular or lance-like in shape with serrated or toothed margins, somewhat reminiscent of the mythical <b>devil's-pitchfork</b> (another common name). The inflorescence consists of a lone orange coloured flower head (i.e. usually multiple <b>disc florets</b> only) surrounded by several prominent oblong or lance-like leafy bracts (Note: two cycles of three).</span></p></div>

The distinctive green to yellow-green leaves of this tree can take on three different shapes, namely three-lobed, two-lobed or uni-lobed. During the fall season they turn beautiful shades of yellow and red. Besides playing host to the larvae of several butterfly species (e.g. eastern tiger swallowtail, spicebush swallowtail) the tree was also harvested by both First Nations People and early European settlers for both its flavourful oils (i.e. <b><a class="one" href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=CHEBI:8994" target="_blank" title="Go to CHEBI">safrole</a></b>) and timber (<b>Immel</b> 2003).</span></p></div>

<div align=center><h3>GLOBAL & REGIONAL RANKINGS</h3></div>

**GRANKS** (**G**, global rankings) and **SRANKS** (**S**, State/Province rankings) provide designations for floral and ecosystem abundance. They are assigned and maintained by several conservation agencies. The following general rankings are from **<a class="one" href="https://explorer.natureserve.org/AboutTheData/DataTypes/ConservationStatusCategories" target="_blank" title="Go to NatureServe">NatureServe</a>**:  
<span id="Red">GX: Presumed Extinct/Collapsed</span>: **Species** <u>presumed extinct</u>, not located despite intensive searches and virtually no likelihood of rediscovery. **Ecosystem** <u>presumed collapsed</u> throughout its range, due to loss of key dominant and characteristic taxa and/or elimination of the sites and ecological processes on which the type depends.  
<span id="Red">GH - Possibly Extinct/Collapsed</span>: **Species** or **Ecosystem** is known from only historical occurrences, but still some hope of rediscovery. Examples of evidence include (1) that a species has not been documented in approximately 20-40 years in human-dominated landscapes despite some searching and/or some evidence of significant habitat loss or degradation; (2) that a species or ecosystem has been searched for unsuccessfully, but not thoroughly enough to presume that it is extinct or collapsed throughout its range.  
<span id="Dred">G1 - Critically Imperiled</span>: At very high risk of extinction or collapse due to very restricted range, very few populations or occurrences, very steep declines, very severe threats, or other factors.  
<span id="Or">G2 - Imperilled</span>: At high risk of extinction or collapse due to restricted range, few populations or occurrences, steep declines, severe threats, or other factors.  
<span id="Gold">G3 - Vulnerable</span>: At moderate risk of extinction or collapse due to a fairly restricted range, relatively few populations or occurrences, recent and widespread declines, threats, or other factors.  
<span id="Blue">G4 - Apparently Secure</span>: At fairly low risk of extinction or collapse due to an extensive range and or many populations or occurrences, but with possible cause for some concern as a result of local recent declines, threats, or other factors.  
<b>G5 - Secure</b>: At very low risk or extinction or collapse due to a very extensive range, abundant populations or occurrences, and little to no concern from declines or threats.  

**GRANK**s and **SRANK**s may also include other designations, notably: **GU** (uncertain global ranking); **G?** (tentative ranking); **Q** (questionable taxonomic status of the species, subspecies, or variety); **T** (rank applies to a subspecies or variety); and **HYB** (hybrid of 2 species); **SH** (plant historically occurred in Ontario, but has not been recorded in the last 20 years); **SR** (plant has been reported without persuasive documentation); **SU** (species has no SRANK value and therefore of uncertain status); **SX** (species apparently extirpated from Ontario with little likelihood of rediscovery); **SE** (species is exotic, not native to Ontario); **?** (some uncertainty about an assigned rank). Rank ranges (e.g. <span id="Dred">S1</span><span id="Or">S2</span>) indicate the uncertain nature of the species rank (i.e. either <span id="Dred">S1</span> or <span id="Or">S2</span>).
