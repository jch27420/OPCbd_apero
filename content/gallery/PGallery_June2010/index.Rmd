It grows in full sun and moist sandy soils (i.e. meadows, prairies, fields, and open woodlands) and each flower is attached via a short stem (i.e. <b>pedicel</b>) to a much larger multi-branched (i.e. <b>panicle</b>) <b>inflorescence</b> (i.e. group of flowers). Thin delicate reddish purple lines mark the lower surface of the white corolla (i.e. nectar guides for pollinators). The flower also has five curving tubular <b>stamens</b>, four of which are black tipped, and a prominent <b>staminode</b> (i.e. sterile <b>stamen</b>) bearing yellowish hairs (i.e. hence the name &ldquo;<i>beard-tongue</i>&rdquo;).

The plant is a native perennial forb that produces a characteristic milky white latex when damaged (<b>Stevens</b> 2006). The latex contains not only <b><a class="one" href="https://opc-project.netlify.app/project/pnps" target="_blank" title="Go to PNP section">isoprene</a></b> (i.e. carbon monomer of natural rubber) but also toxic compounds such as <b><a class="one" href="https://opc-project.netlify.app/project/pnps" target="_blank" title="Go to PNP section">cardiac glycosides</a></b> (<b>Agrawal and Konno</b> 2009). Many insect species (over 400) that feed on <i>Asclepias</i> spp. like the larva of the <b>Monarch butterfly</b> (<i>Danaus plexippus</i>) and <b>Red Milkweed Beetles</b> store toxic cardenolides in their tissues to ward off predators (<b>Parson</b> 1965, <b>Reichstein</b> et. al. 1968, <b>Agrawal</b> et. al. 2012, <b>Lopez-Goldar</b> et. al. 2022). Both <b>Waugh</b> (1916) and <b>Gilmore</b> (1919) also mentioned that First Nations People use different parts of the plant as food (i.e. young sprouts, floral buds, and young green fruit pods).</span></p></div>

The fragrant flowers have five light pink petals and a showy yellow centre sporting over 100 stamens. Unlike some related species (<i>R. palustris</i> and <i>R. virginiana</i>) the needle-like thorns on this rose species are straight not curved. It can be found in thickets and open woodlands. <b>Arnason</b> et. al. 1981 mentions that the buds of some species of <b>Roses</b> (e.g. <i>R. virginiana</i>) were occasional eaten by the <b>Ojibwa</b>.

The flowers are composed of multiple (50-100) <b>ray florets</b> (usually white) and a central yellow <b>disc floret</b>. Apparently they exhibit a certain degree of morphological plasticity and are therefore often mistaken for other closely related <b>Fleabanes</b> such as <i>Erigeron annuus</i>. However, the leaves of this plant are simple, narrow, and generally smooth along the margins. They also become smaller as you ascend the plant. In addition, the stems are <b>strigose</b> (i.e. hairs pressed against stem, upwards and not outwards as is typical of <i>Erigeron annuus</i>) or minutely <b>strigose</b> (i.e. <b>strigilose</b>).</span></p></div>

Unfortunately <b>COSEWIC</b> (2015) lists the species as highly threatened and no existing habitat is regulated under current provincial law. <b>COSEWIC</b> (2015) estimates that there are only ~14,600 plants, mostly (~93%) located within a 12 km<sup>2</sup> area of Essex county. All existing sub-populations are imperilled due to the continued fragmentation and loss of habitat.</span></p></div>

The plant is a native perennial forb and an important food resource for many pollinating insects, most notably butterflies (<b>Stevens</b> 2006). First Nations People used the roots of the plant to treat respiratory illnesses (i.e. aka: <b>Pleuresy root</b>). According to <b>Gilmore</b> (1919) the &ldquo;<i>...root was eaten raw for bronchial and pulmonary trouble</i>&rdquo;. It's also interesting to note that the concentration of <b><a class="one" href="https://opc-project.netlify.app/project/pnps" target="_blank" title="Go to PNP section">cardiac glycosides</a></b> within the leaves of <i>A. tuberosa</i> are much lower than those found in other milkweed species (<b>Agrawal</b> et. al 2009), which may help to explain why it is not the preferred host plant of <b>Monarch butterflies</b>. <i>S. edwardsii</i> feeding on <b>Butterfly weed</b> is a common site at <b>OPC</b> due in part to the presence of oaks since their larvae feed on <i>Quercus</i> species. The distinguishing features of this butterfly include the row of white-rimmed spots on the underside and the prominent orange mark along the inner margin of the hind-wing.</span></p></div>

It is a member of the family <i>Liliaceae</i> and can be found in Tallgrass prairies, lake shores and wet woodland margins.

Its bright yellow flowers have five petals, each bearing tiny black coloured dot-like glands along their margins. They also have many prominent yellow stamens flaring our from the centre of the flower. The species earned its &ldquo;<i>perforatum</i>&rdquo; name by having many small translucent leaf glands that are clearly visible when the leaf is held up to the sun. Although exotic and invasive to disturbed areas its extensive root system does help to control soil erosion. It's also a good source of nectar for many pollinating insects (<b>Sheahan</b> 2012).</span></p></div>

<div align=center><h3>GLOBAL & REGIONAL RANKINGS</h3></div>

**GRANKS** (**G**, global rankings) and **SRANKS** (**S**, State/Province rankings) provide designations for floral and ecosystem abundance. They are assigned and maintained by several conservation agencies. The following general rankings are from **<a class="one" href="https://explorer.natureserve.org/AboutTheData/DataTypes/ConservationStatusCategories" target="_blank" title="Go to NatureServe">NatureServe</a>**:  
<span id="Red">GX: Presumed Extinct/Collapsed</span>: **Species** <u>presumed extinct</u>, not located despite intensive searches and virtually no likelihood of rediscovery. **Ecosystem** <u>presumed collapsed</u> throughout its range, due to loss of key dominant and characteristic taxa and/or elimination of the sites and ecological processes on which the type depends.  
<span id="Red">GH - Possibly Extinct/Collapsed</span>: **Species** or **Ecosystem** is known from only historical occurrences, but still some hope of rediscovery. Examples of evidence include (1) that a species has not been documented in approximately 20-40 years in human-dominated landscapes despite some searching and/or some evidence of significant habitat loss or degradation; (2) that a species or ecosystem has been searched for unsuccessfully, but not thoroughly enough to presume that it is extinct or collapsed throughout its range.  
<span id="Dred">G1 - Critically Imperiled</span>: At very high risk of extinction or collapse due to very restricted range, very few populations or occurrences, very steep declines, very severe threats, or other factors.  
<span id="Or">G2 - Imperilled</span>: At high risk of extinction or collapse due to restricted range, few populations or occurrences, steep declines, severe threats, or other factors.  
<span id="Gold">G3 - Vulnerable</span>: At moderate risk of extinction or collapse due to a fairly restricted range, relatively few populations or occurrences, recent and widespread declines, threats, or other factors.  
<span id="Blue">G4 - Apparently Secure</span>: At fairly low risk of extinction or collapse due to an extensive range and or many populations or occurrences, but with possible cause for some concern as a result of local recent declines, threats, or other factors.  
<b>G5 - Secure</b>: At very low risk or extinction or collapse due to a very extensive range, abundant populations or occurrences, and little to no concern from declines or threats.  

**GRANK**s and **SRANK**s may also include other designations, notably: **GU** (uncertain global ranking); **G?** (tentative ranking); **Q** (questionable taxonomic status of the species, subspecies, or variety); **T** (rank applies to a subspecies or variety); and **HYB** (hybrid of 2 species); **SH** (plant historically occurred in Ontario, but has not been recorded in the last 20 years); **SR** (plant has been reported without persuasive documentation); **SU** (species has no SRANK value and therefore of uncertain status); **SX** (species apparently extirpated from Ontario with little likelihood of rediscovery); **SE** (species is exotic, not native to Ontario); **?** (some uncertainty about an assigned rank). Rank ranges (e.g. <span id="Dred">S1</span><span id="Or">S2</span>) indicate the uncertain nature of the species rank (i.e. either <span id="Dred">S1</span> or <span id="Or">S2</span>).
