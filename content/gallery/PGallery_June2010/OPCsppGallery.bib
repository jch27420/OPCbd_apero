	abstract = {Cardenolides are classically studied steroidal defenses in chemical ecology and plant-herbivore coevolution. Although milkweed plants (Asclepias spp.) produce up to 200 structurally different cardenolides, all compounds seemingly share the same well-characterized mode of action, inhibition of the ubiquitous Na(+)/K(+) ATPase in animal cells. Over their evolutionary radiation, milkweeds show a quantitative decline of cardenolide production and diversity. This reduction is contrary to coevolutionary predictions and could represent a cost-saving strategy, i.e. production of fewer but more toxic cardenolides. Here we test this hypothesis by tandem cardenolide quantification using HPLC (UV absorption of the unsaturated lactone) and a pharmacological assay (in vitro inhibition of a sensitive Na(+)/K(+) ATPase) in a comparative study of 16 species of Asclepias. We contrast cardenolide concentrations in leaf tissue to the subset of cardenolides present in exuding latex. Results from the two quantification methods were strongly correlated, but the enzymatic assay revealed that milkweed cardenolide mixtures often cause stronger inhibition than equal amounts of a non-milkweed reference cardenolide, ouabain. Cardenolide concentrations in latex and leaves were positively correlated across species, yet latex caused 27\% stronger enzyme inhibition than equimolar amounts of leaf cardenolides. Using a novel multiple regression approach, we found three highly potent cardenolides (identified as calactin, calotropin, and voruscharin) to be primarily responsible for the increased pharmacological activity of milkweed cardenolide mixtures. However, contrary to an expected trade-off between concentration and toxicity, later-diverging milkweeds had the lowest amounts of these potent cardenolides, perhaps indicating an evolutionary response to milkweed's diverse community of specialist cardenolide-sequestering insect herbivores.},

	abstract = {The extent of convergent molecular evolution is largely unknown, yet is critical to understanding the genetics of adaptation. Target site insensitivity to cardenolides is a prime candidate for studying molecular convergence because herbivores in six orders of insects have specialized on these plant poisons, which gain their toxicity by blocking an essential transmembrane carrier, the sodium pump (Na,K-ATPase). We investigated gene sequences of the Na,K-ATPase alpha-subunit in 18 insects feeding on cardenolide-containing plants (spanning 15 genera and four orders) to screen for amino acid substitutions that might lower sensitivity to cardenolides. The replacement N122H that was previously shown to confer resistance in the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) and Chrysochus leaf beetles was found in four additional species, Oncopeltus fasciatus and Lygaeus kalmii (Heteroptera, Lygaeidae), Labidomera clivicollis (Coleoptera, Chrysomelidae), and Liriomyza asclepiadis (Diptera, Agromyzidae). Thus, across 300 Myr of insect divergence, specialization on cardenolide-containing plants resulted in molecular convergence for an adaptation likely involved in coevolution. Our screen revealed a number of other substitutions connected to cardenolide binding in mammals. We confirmed that some of the particular substitutions provide resistance to cardenolides by introducing five distinct constructs of the Drosophila melanogaster gene into susceptible eucaryotic cells under an ouabain selection regime. These functional assays demonstrate that combined substitutions of Q(111) and N(122) are synergistic, with greater than twofold higher resistance than either substitution alone and \{\vphantom{\}}{\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash}12-fold resistance over the wild type. Thus, even across deep phylogenetic branches, evolutionary degrees of freedom seem to be limited by physiological constraints, such that the same molecular substitutions confer adaptation.},

	abstract = {Cardenolides are remarkable steroidal toxins that have become model systems, critical in the development of theories for chemical ecology and coevolution. Because cardenolides inhibit the ubiquitous and essential animal enzyme Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase, most insects that feed on cardenolide-containing plants are highly specialized. With a huge diversity of chemical forms, these secondary metabolites are sporadically distributed across 12 botanical families, but dominate the Apocynaceae where they are found in \{\vphantom{\}}{\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash} 30 genera. Studies over the past decade have demonstrated patterns in the distribution of cardenolides among plant organs, including all tissue types, and across broad geographic gradients within and across species. Cardenolide production has a genetic basis and is subject to natural selection by herbivores. In addition, there is strong evidence for phenotypic plasticity, with the biotic and abiotic environment predictably impacting cardenolide production. Mounting evidence indicates a high degree of specificity in herbivore-induced cardenolides in Asclepias. While herbivores of cardenolide-containing plants often sequester the toxins, are aposematic, and possess several physiological adaptations (including target site insensitivity), there is strong evidence that these specialists are nonetheless negatively impacted by cardenolides. While reviewing both the mechanisms and evolutionary ecology of cardenolide-mediated interactions, we advance novel hypotheses and suggest directions for future work.},

	abstract = {Although plant-defense theory has long predicted patterns of chemical defense across taxa, we know remarkably little about the evolution of defense, especially in the context of directional phylogenetic trends. Here we contrast the production of phenolics and cardenolides in 35 species of milkweeds (Asclepias and Gomphocarpus). Maximum-likelihood analyses of character evolution revealed three major patterns. First, consistent with the defense-escalation hypothesis, the diversification of the milkweeds was associated with a trend for increasing phenolic production; this pattern was reversed (a declining evolutionary trend) for cardenolides, toxins sequestered by specialist herbivores. Second, phylogenetically independent correlations existed among phenolic classes across species. For example, coumaric acid derivatives showed negatively correlated evolution with caffeic acid derivatives, and this was likely driven by the fact that the former are used as precursors for the latter. In contrast, coumaric acid derivatives were positively correlated with flavonoids, consistent with competition for the precursor p-coumaric acid. Finally, of the phenolic classes, only flavonoids showed correlated evolution (positive) with cardenolides, consistent with a physiological and evolutionary link between the two via malonate. Thus, this study presents a rigorous test of the defense-escalation hypothesis and a novel phylogenetic approach to understanding the long-term persistence of physiological constraints on secondary metabolism.},

By reducing the abundance of dominant plants and releasing subordinates from competitive exclusion, they can have an outsized impact on plant communities. Most research on the ecological role of hemiparasites is manipulative and focuses on a small number of hemiparasitic taxa. Here, we ask whether patterns in natural plant communities match the expectation that hemiparasites affect the structure of plant communities. Our data were collected on 129 national park units spanning the continental United States. The most common hemiparasite genera were Pedicularis, Castilleja, Krameria, and Comandra. We used null models and linear mixed models to determine whether hemiparasites were associated with changes in community richness and evenness. Hemiparasite presence did not affect community metrics. Hemiparasite abundance was positively associated with increasing evenness of herbaceous species, but not with species richness. The associations that we observed on a continental scale are consistent with evidence that the impacts of root hemiparasitic plants on evenness can be substantial and abundance dependent but that effects on richness are less pronounced. Hemiparasites mediate competitive exclusion in communities to facilitate species coexistence and merit consideration of inclusion in ecological theories of coexistence.},

We investigated the effects of light and mineral nutrients on hemiparasite-host relations in two experiments. Removal of the hemiparasite, addition of fertilizer, and full sun significantly increased total aboveground dry mass in small plots on a restored tallgrass prairie. After 3 years, removal of Pedicularis canadensis almost doubled the mass of grasses and had smaller effects on forb species, but the impact of the parasite was independent of resource level. Fertilizer increased grass growth only in full sun, increased non-legume forb growth only when shade was applied, and tended to depress legume growth when shaded. Light manipulation did not affect the hemiparasite across 4 years of manipulation but fertilizer increased P. canadensis shoot mass. A complementary greenhouse experiment with Andropogon gerardii as host produced qualitatively similar effects and showed that shade reduced root growth of both the host and the parasite. These results do not support common assumptions regarding hemiparasite-host relations under field conditions but indicate that a small hemiparasite can significantly affect prairie productivity regardless of resource supply.},

Are root hemiparasites more associated with species-rich vegetation than other species? Location Czech Republic. Methods Plot size-corrected species richness, Shannon diversity and Pielou's evenness were computed for a representative set of 18 101 vegetation plots representing all main types of terrestrial open (non-forest) habitats of the country. Null models of species richness assuming occurrence of a random species with given occurrence frequency, reflecting higher incidence probability in species-rich plots, were constructed for 16 common root hemiparasitic species. The null model distribution of species richness was subsequently compared with the actual mean species richness of plots containing the respective root hemiparasites. Median values of plot Shannon diversity and evenness were computed for each species in the database. Values obtained for plots containing individual root hemiparasites were compared with distribution of values for other species in the database. Results The occurrence of 11 of 16 root hemiparasites studied was associated with high species richness significantly more than under random expectations; three species were negatively associated. Three root hemiparasites were among the top 5\% of all species associated with high species richness and Shannon diversity, and eight were among the top 25\%. Almost 50\% of the top 1\% most species-rich plots contained at least one root hemiparasitic species. Conclusions We demonstrated a positive association between the incidence of most root hemiparasites and diversity of non-forest terrestrial plant communities at a broad landscape scale. This finding scales up the results of experimental studies that showed some root hemiparasites act as ecosystem engineers, increasing vegetation diversity. Root hemiparasites should be regarded as important biodiversity indicators and potential drivers of biodiversity. As such, conserving their wild populations or promoting their establishment should become a goal of nature conservation and ecological restoration.},

Soc. 132: 401–410. 2005.—Pedicularis canadensis (lousewort) is a hemiparasitic plant of open woodland and prairie habitats. The interactions between this hemiparasitic plant and selected members of a tallgrass prairie community were investigated via a greenhouse experiment and field observations in a restored prairie. The greenhouse experiment examined interactions between P. canadensis and hosts from each of three families prominent in prairie communities: big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii, Poaceae), tall goldenrod (Solidago canadensis, Asteraceae), and showy tick trefoil (Desmodium canadense, Fabaceae). Individual hemiparasites were grown with one host, with two hosts of a single species, or with two hosts of different species, in all combinations. P. canadensis reduced tall goldenrod shoot mass, marginally affected big bluestem shoot mass, and had no effect on root mass of these two host species or on shoot and root mass of showy tick trefoil. The presence of the hemiparasite did not alter competitive relationships between host species and its effect was similar to that of a competitor. Spearman rank correlations were calculated between P. canadensis cover and species richness and abundances, including bare ground, for Six-Mile Creek Prairie, a restored tallgrass prairie in McLean County, Illinois. Species richness was positively correlated with increasing P. canadensis cover. These results suggest P. canadensis can influence prairie community composition.},

	abstract = {The alpine biome, above the natural tree line, is home to distinctive biotas that can tolerate harsh environmental conditions, and is especially sensitive to the impacts of global warming. However, the actual timeframe during which alpine floras began to appear on a global scale remains unknown. Here, we used Anemone (c. 200 species), an herbaceous plant genus inhabiting a variety of habitats from lowland to high-alpine zone across multiple continents, to obtain new insights into the historical assembly of this biome. Using nuclear ITS and plastid atpB-rbcL, trnL-F, matK, and rbcL sequences, we built a phylogeny that includes 159 individuals of 146 extant Anemone species and 19 outgroups. Within this phylogenetic framework, we estimated divergence times, reconstructed ancestral ranges, and inferred the evolutionary shifts in habitat types. Phylogenetic analyses strongly support the non-monophyletic Anemone, in which the Clematis-Anemoclema clade is nested. Two subgenera of Anemone, subg. Anemone and subg. Anemonidium, are strongly supported as monophyletic. Except for Anemone sect. Keiskea, whose Anemone deltoidea is grouped with A. sect. Hepatica, the other seven sections of this genus are monophyletic. Anemone originated in East Asian non-alpine habitats around 31 Ma, but range expansion and habitat shifts from non-alpine to alpine mainly occurred after the Miocene Climatic Optimum (c. 14 Ma). The alpine Anemone lineages in different biogeographic regions originated near-synchronously, beginning in the middle Miocene (c. 16–12 Ma). We also found that the other alpine floristic elements across multiple continents emerged roughly at the same time. Our findings suggest that the rise of global alpine floras is near-synchronous and began in the middle Miocene, possibly in association with the mid-Miocene global cooling and regional orogenetic activities. The mid-late Miocene is an essential period for the assembly and evolution of global alpine floras. The alpine floristic diversity comprises pre-adapted immigrants from other alpine zones through long-distance dispersal and descendants from local lowland ancestors, as well as from other regional lowland ancestors to a lesser extent.},

	abstract = {Species-rich grasslands have high conservation value because they support diverse floral and faunal assemblages. Alpine grassland is an important and characteristic ecosystem of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, but ca. 30 \% has been severely degraded by the combined effects of climate change, human activity, overgrazing and rodent damage. One potential method to restore grassland diversity involves using hemiparasitic plants to modify the competitive relationships among neighboring species. A possible candidate is Pedicularis kansuensis, a hemiparasitic plant found in grasslands throughout the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, but more information on its host associations and its effects on surrounding vegetation is required to assess its suitability. Thus, we examined host associations of P. kansuensis by direct root excavation at a selected site on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and found that haustoria formation is non-randomly distributed among host species, with preferential bias for members of Poaceae, Rosaceae and Fabaceae. We also found that aboveground biomass of grasses and legumes was higher in quadrats from which the parasite had been removed than in intact controls, while the biomass of sedges and forbs was unaffected by parasite removal. However, removal significantly decreased plant species richness and Shannon–Wiener diversity. These results suggest that P. kansuensis modifies the competitive balance in grassland communities of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, allowing for colonization by subordinate species and thereby enhancing species diversity and contributing to restoration of these degraded grasslands.},

	abstract = {This thesis explores the history of food and nutrition in Indigenous communities in mid- to late-twentieth century Canada. It does so through tracing changes in state policies and procedures, as well as Indigenous approaches to foodways, health, and healing from the 1960s into the 1980s. It looks at how shifting discourses of nutrition and food science impacted educational materials and programs for Indigenous peoples, often aimed at mothers and children in Indigenous communities, and highlights a moment of possibility in the early 1980s when Indigenous peoples were increasingly being consulted on and leading state programs tailored to their communities and cultures. It aims to privilege the experiences of Indigenous peoples through the choice of sources and attention to Indigenous methodologies. It therefore includes discussion of Indigenous activism and its impact on health and healing, food production and preparation, land use and agriculture, and data collection used for food and nutrition surveys. Central to this dissertation is the concern that Indigenous peoples have been studied, pathologized, and racialized as part of a long history of settler-colonialism in Canada. Many of the state nutrition projects that informed policies and programs during the period were organized and carried out by non-Indigenous experts and their cadres, with a very top-down approach. These mirror colonial initiatives dating back a century in the most heavily studied regions, singling out Indigenous peoples as a unique category of subjects to be studied separately from the rest of the population. Accordingly, it focuses heavily on Manitoba and the Northwest Territories, regions that were often the focus of Medical Services Branch initiatives. In studying the history of ‘Aboriginal nutrition’ as a growing field of expertise during the period, this dissertation challenges narratives of decline, dispossession, and displacement of Indigenous peoples that have dominated Canadian history. It contributes to the growing literature that works instead to centre Indigenous peoples and their experiences of modernity, in this case their foodways and nutritional knowledge. It does so by exploring gender, food, and emotions as categories of historical analysis helpful in peeling back the layered relationships between Indigenous peoples and representatives of the state.},

Iroquoian agriculturalists of southern Ontario cultivated corn, beans, squash, tobacco, and sunflowers, and gathered the greatest variety of food plants. Southern and eastern Algonkian hunters and gatherers ate a wide variety of wild plant foods including fleshy fruits, nuts, greens, and underground parts. Little is known about the use of wild food plants by northern Cree and Naskapi.Nutritional data for gathered plants indicate that many of these species exceed conventional plant sources for vitamins and minerals. Vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, iron, and fibre are particularly well represented in certain gathered plants. Some wild plant foods require special preparation or must be consumed in limited quantities because they contain toxic secondary metabolites.Over 400 plants are used in native medicine. Native medicine consists of rational and ritualistic components. Treatment of physical disorders, whose origin could be determined, was effective. At least 105 medicinal plants have a real effectiveness based on phytochemical constituents. Conifers were the most widely used group of plants in this category. Antibiotic monoterpenes, polyacetylenes and alkaloids, astringent tannins, and analgesic monoterpenes and salicylates are among the most rationally and widely used plant constituents.There is need for more research into nutritional constituents and pharmacological properties to assess the value and potential of plants used by Native People of eastern Canada.},

Contemporary medicine has demonstrated many potential health benefits of berries due to their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity. Indigenous Peoples have not only utilized berries as food, likely over many centuries, but have also passed down knowledge on the medicinal uses of various parts of these plants including the fruits, leaves and roots.

The regal fritillary and Diana fritillary are species of concern, whereas the great spangled fritillary, Atlantis fritillary, and Aphrodite fritillary are relatively abundant within their respective ranges. However, the Atlantis fritillary and Aphrodite fritillary have experienced severe population declines within the last few decades. We created ecological niche models for these five species by combining each species’ known occurrences with climate and environmental variables to identify important response variables and determine the potential distribution of suitable habitat for each species. Important climate variables differed among species, although minimum temperature of the coldest month was important for great spangled, Atlantis, and Aphrodite fritillaries. The regal fritillary responded the most to temperature seasonality, whereas the Diana fritillary responded to maximum temperature of warmest month and the great spangled fritillary responded to annual precipitation. Land use was important for all species except the regal fritillary and average annual relative humidity was important for all species except the great spangled fritillary. This study highlights the different climate and habitat needs for greater fritillary species with important implications for how each species is expected to be impacted by climate change. We also demonstrate the value of citizen science and photo sharing websites for providing important data for evaluating species distributions.},

	abstract = {Floriculture and horticulture have always been two parallel and very distinct agronomic realities. Floriculture is concerned with meeting the ornamental needs of our urban ecosystems, while horticulture is based on meeting food requirements. These two activities have now converged toward a food chain where flowers are conceived of as a sort of “new vegetable” and one of the most promising novelties to satisfy the growing need for food innovation both in terms of an organoleptic and nutraceutical profile. This novelty has rapidly evolved, especially following the growing scientific evidence of the human health benefits of flowers used as food. The typically high pigment concentration of the corollas (especially flavonoids and carotenoids), which have evolved to chromatically attract pollinators, indicates a marked nutraceutical activity especially in terms of antioxidant power. In this review, we first attempted to explore which species are most promising and which should be avoided due to real or suspected toxicity problems. The nutraceutical virtues were therefore highlighted trying to focus attention on those “functional phytochemicals” capable of counteracting some specific human pathologies. Furthermore, the organoleptic profile of edible flowers was investigated since this is one of the least known aspects. The cropping systems suitable for their cultivation were therefore hypothesized and finally the criticalities of edible flowers were addressed in terms of shelf life and marketing opportunities.},

Both species are vernal-flowering herbs, with yellow perianths, providing pollen as their only reward. In H. hirsuta, hand self-pollinated, emasculated and bagged control flowers failed to set fruit. When cross-pollinated, 77\% of the pistils produced seed-filled capsules while 72\% of open, insect-pollinated flowers set seed. Epifluorescence showed that most germinating grains failed to penetrate the stigmatic surface {\textgreater} 24 h after hand self-pollination suggesting early-acting self-incompatibility (SI). The majority of pollinators of H. hirsuta were female bees representing 21 species distributed in four families. Pollen load analyses indicated that most bees were polylectic and carried grains of H. hirsuta mixed with pollen of co-blooming, nectariferous species. In contrast, capsule production of H. aurea was 60\% for open, insect-pollinated flowers. Pollen tubes of H. aurea also entered ovules within 24 h, and SI of this species was partial. Evidence of a late-acting rejection in this species following self-pollination included abnormal growth of pollen tubes in styles with fewer tubes penetrating ovules. In contrast, abnormal tube growth was not observed in styles of H. hirsuta. Hypoxis aurea received fewer insect visitations. Pollen was dispersed primarily by hoverflies (Syrphidae) followed by bees. Floral presentation, generalist pollination and two modes of SI found in these two Hypoxis species contribute to our understanding of floral evolution for congeners isolated on different continents.},

It is endangered in several states and has been the subject of special conservation efforts. A number of native populations of this species arose spontaneously at Pleasant Valley Conservancy State Natural Area in south-central Wisconsin after oak savanna restoration was initiated in 1997. Ecological observations of permanently marked stands made over a ten-year period have shown that growth is highly variable from year to year, and flowering and seed set are sporadic and unpredictable. Germination studies have determined that seed viability is very high. Greenhouse-raised plants have been successfully transplanted to the field and followed for three years. Transplants have also been used in a forbs garden, where plants could be monitored more effectively. Pod formation and seed set are highly variable, both in the field and in the forbs garden, and may partly explain the rarity of this species.},

	abstract = {Life history differences among seven species of Asclepias (A. exaltata, A. incarnata, A. purpurascens, A. syriaca, A. tuberosa, A. verticillata and A. viridiflora) in south-east Michigan are correlated with differences in microhabitat, in exposure to herbivores, and in competition. Components of each species' reproductive strategy include: number of stems per plants, number of umbels per stem, number of flowers and pods per umbel, number of seeds per pod, seed weight and annual increase in reproductive potential. Components of each species' selective regime include: the herbivore load (measured by the frequency of plants damaged by predators or animal parasites), competition (measured by the proportion of non-flowering plants and by the density of competitors), and environmental uncertainty (measured by annual mortality rates). The study involved observation of 3482 individually labelled plants during portions of three growing seasons. The seven species are long-lived perennials and have a common pollination system and mechanism of dispersal. Within this adaptive zone the species have a variety of mechanisms of seed production adjusted to the pattern of herbivore damage and opportunities for seedling establishment. A. exaltata is a woodland species with a high herbivore load and low annual reproductive output, but with a remarkable ability to withstand herbivore damage from deer and the chrysomelid beetle Labidomera clivicollis. Asclepias incarnata is a wetland species with relatively low annual survival due to erosion of pond banks; seedling densities are often very high and each plant produces many pods, each with a few large seeds. A. purpurascens is rare in the study area; it is similar to A. exaltata but has more seeds per pod. A. syriaca is a ubiquitous weed of open upland habitats and is the only species with vegetative propagation. It has many seeds in each pod and a prolonged flowering season. The cerambycid beetle Tetraopes tetrophthalmus and the weevil Rhyssomatus have a coevolved relationship with Asclepias syriaca. A. tuberosa invades the highly diverse and stable old-field forb community. Once established this species has a very high annual survival, virtually no herbivore load, and low annual seed output. A. viridiflora is widely distributed in old-field habitats. It has a heavy herbivore load, long flowering season and large seed crop. A. verticillata occurs in scattered colonies on dry open hillsides. It has a long flowering season, low herbivore load, long prereproductive period and a large crop of small seeds. This study demonstrates that interpretations of the evolution of reproductive patterns should involve considerations of herbivore loads and environmental uncertainty as well as competition and the growth trajectory of the population.},

Dominant forbs were Pycnanthemum virginianum, Liatris spicata, Fragaria virginiana, Lysimachia quadriflora, and Viola papilionacea. Stands were ordered along a recognized moisture–substrate gradient divided into four segments; dry-mesic sandy, mesic sandy loam, wet-mesic sandy loam, and wet loam. Many species showed preferences for certain regions of the gradient. Species richness ranged between 44 and 91 species per stand. The composition of the vegetation was summarized for the four segments, using prevalent species lists. Effectiveness of the direct gradient analysis was assessed by ordination using reciprocal averaging and polar ordination. Percent sand, percent organic matter, and depth of A horizon were significant correlates of the primary axis. Frequent burning of the prairie by the Indians has effectively maintained these prairies. The composition of the Walpole Island prairies is similar to those in Michigan, Illinois, and Wisconsin, forming part of the eastern tallgrass prairie.},

	doi = {10.1111/mec.16450},
	abstract = {Coevolution between plants and herbivores often involves escalation of defence-offence strategies, but attack by multiple herbivores may obscure the match of plant defence to any one attacker. As herbivores often specialize on distinct plant parts, we hypothesized that defence-offence interactions in coevolved systems may become physiologically and evolutionarily compartmentalized between plant tissues. We report that roots, leaves, flower buds and seeds of the tropical milkweed (Asclepias curassavica) show increasing concentrations of cardenolide toxins acropetally, with latex showing the highest concentration. In vitro assays of the physiological target of cardenolides, the Na+ /K+ -ATPase (hereafter "sodium pump"), of three specialized milkweed herbivores (root-feeding Tetraopes tetrophthalmus, leaf-feeding Danaus plexippus, and seed-feeding Oncopeltus fasciatus) show that they are proportionally tolerant to the cardenolide concentrations of the tissues they eat. Indeed, molecular substitutions in the insects' sodium pumps predicted their tolerance to toxins from their target tissues. Nonetheless, the relative inhibition of the sodium pumps of these specialists by the concentration versus composition (inhibition controlled for concentration, what we term "potency") of cardenolides from their target versus nontarget plant tissues revealed different degrees of insect adaptation to tissue-specific toxins. In addition, a trade-off between toxin concentration and potency emerged across plant tissues, potentially reflecting coevolutionary history or plant physiological constraints. Our findings suggest that tissue-specific coevolutionary dynamics may be proceeding between the plant and its specialized community of herbivores. This novel finding may be common in nature, contributing to ways in which coevolution proceeds in multispecies communities.},

Cerambycid beetles of the genus Tetraopes contained small quantities of cardenolides. while two genera of chrysomelid beetles, Chrysochus and Labidomera, contained little or no cardenolides in their bodies. All of these insects are thought to be warningly coloured. The cardenolide content of Tetraopes, in contrast with other milkweed herbivores such as the lygaeid bugs Oncopeltus fasciatus and Lygaeus kalmii, appears to be limited by physiological factors, rather than the cardenolide content of the host plant. Cardenolides were not detected in the pupae of an arctiid moth which has an aposematic larva, a cryptic grasshopper, or a cryptic plant hopper, all of which fed on milkweeds known to contain cardenolides. The implication for chemical defense and the position of these insects in mimicry complexes is briefly discussed. It appears that few of the principal milkweed-feeding insects in temperate North America may use host-derived cardenolides as a chemical defense strategy.},

	abstract = {Beetles in the genus Tetraopes share a long evolutionary history with milkweeds (Asclepias spp.), feeding on roots as larvae and leaves as adults. Despite their extreme specialization on milkweed, Tetraopes require drying grass stems as oviposition sites, even though they do not consume grass. The natural history of the interaction suggests that herbivory may be likely only when milkweeds are in close proximity to grasses. Theory also predicts that two stresses on plants, competition and herbivory, may have non-additive negative impacts on correlates of fitness. In field experiments conducted over two years, I followed the consequences of grass competition and beetle attack for herbivory, growth, and reproduction of milkweed, and reciprocal effects of milkweed on grass in common gardens. To assess the effect of milkweed traits on beetles, I conducted a quantitative genetic experiment using full-sibling families of milkweed and measured the effects of putative resistance traits on the abundance of Tetraopes adults. Milkweeds growing next to grass were initially unaffected in growth but suffered 10\% greater leaf herbivory by adult Tetraopes than did milkweeds growing alone. This effect was caused by direct attraction of beetles to grass, not by a competitive modification of milkweed's phenotype. In late summer of the first growing season, when Tetraopes naturally oviposits, I experimentally added larvae to milkweed roots with and without grass competition. Within a month, I detected an interaction between competition and herbivory: neither had an individual impact, but jointly they reduced milkweed growth. In spring of the second growing season, when Tetraopes had completed development, I again found strong evidence for a non-additive effect of competition and herbivory together, severely reducing plant growth compared to their individual effects. Root herbivory induced a plant response that reduced the abundance of leaf-mining flies by 40\%, but only for milkweeds with grass competition. Neither competition nor herbivory affected the production of defensive latex, cardenolides, or carbon, but they interacted to affect leaf nitrogen content. Thus, although trait-mediated indirect interactions were implicated in the effect of competition and root herbivory on leaf miner abundance, I did not uncover the mechanism. In the final harvest, beetle herbivory reduced reproductive characters (fruit production, fruit mass, aboveground biomass) by 20– 30\%, whereas competition had negligible effects. The net interaction effect for grass was competitive, with a 23\% reduction in grass biomass caused by milkweed in the absence of herbivory. However, the presence of beetle herbivory on milkweed roots completely alleviated the competitive effect of milkweed on grass. Thus, the associational effect of grass on milkweed resulted in milkweed suffering the non-additive effects of competition and herbivory, whereas grass enjoyed competitive release by facilitating its neighbor's herbivore. Many traits of milkweed (e.g., growth, reproduction, and several resistance traits) showed variation among 23 full-sibling families, indicating that competitive ability and resistance may be subject to natural selection. A multiple regression analysis on family means revealed that leaf trichome density and nitrogen content were negatively genetically correlated with abundance of Tetraopes adults, but probability of flowering and plant height were positively associated. Leaf miners were most strongly negatively affected by latex and trichomes. Thus, complex interactions among competition, root herbivory, and plant genetic variation affect the herbivore and plant community and may result in diffuse coevolution between milkweed and its herbivores. I present a general model that predicts the conditions in which plant–plant interactions result in net competition or facilitation.},
